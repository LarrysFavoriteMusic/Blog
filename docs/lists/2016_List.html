<p>This is the list that started it all: made from a undergrad who wanted to stay entertained during finals week. Despite this being my first list, I’m impressed with how well it’s held up. The music quality in 2016 was just amazing, with amazing albums I don’t cover here that include (and are not limited to) David Bowie’s final record “Blackstar”, Anderson Paak’s “Malibu”, Frank Ocean’s “Blonde”, Pinegrove’s “Cardinal”, and Deerhoof’s “The Magic” (which remains my favorite album of theirs from a very long and impressive catalog). The albums that are on this list still find their way into my listening queues on fairly regular basis. I also didn’t make a top songs playlist to accompany the album list so I’ll name a handful tracks that remain favorites to me, but tracks that really stand out to me from this year include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Andy Shauf’s haunting opening track “The Magician”</p></li>
<li><p>The controlled chaos that is Car Seat Headrest’s “Vincent”</p></li>
<li><p>The incredibly catchy jazz rap from Jalen Santoy, “Foreplay”</p></li>
<li><p>The country/bluegrass layered in harmonies, “It’s Getting Late” by Honeysuckle</p></li>
<li><p>The indie rock ear worm combined with subtly great guitar work, “Emotions and Math” from Margaret Glaspy</p></li>
<li><p>Ripping guitars and emotional vocals on “Real Love” from an excellent debut from Big Thief (keep an eye on these guys)</p></li>
<li><p>The euphoric slow burn on “Hidden Driver” by LVL Up</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, the delightful track from a one off project super group project named case/lang/veirs, “Atomic Number”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Plus tons of other songs, some of which I feature in this list. This</p>
<section id="lucy-dacus-no-burden" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lucy-dacus-no-burden">10. Lucy Dacus: No Burden</h2>
<p>This would serve to be a really solid debut for Lucy Dacus, going on to create music that would make it on to my future lists. The album is full of introspective lyrics like on “I Don’t Wanna Be Funny”, which talks about her wanting to be more than just a funny person. But as far as I’m concerned, Lucy’s biggest strength is her soothing voice, which enhances her words. “Map on the Wall” serves as a nice slow burn track, helping to fill out the rest of the album. All in all, a really great debut.</p>

<section id="ry-x-dawn" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ry-x-dawn">9. RY X: Dawn</h2>
<p>At the time of writing this, I honestly hadn’t listened to this record in quite some time. Going back and listening reminded me what I saw in this album. This record is filled with lush strings and subtle beats, topped off with Ry Cuming’s gentle vocals. In particular, “Howling” has this simple little bit and yet does so much to make the song an earworm. “Berlin” remains a super hit for this artist (179 million streams on spotify) and probably the best vocal performance on the record as Ry’s voice matches the guitar note for note in the background. A true highlight is the gorgeous “Beacon” led by the an orchestral string section the builds with guitars and percussion in the background. This album serves as a perfect late-night companion, and one that likely will find myself spending time with in the future.</p>

<section id="klangstof-closure" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="klangstof-closure">8. Klangstof: Closure</h2>
<p>I have yet to find anything that sounds quite like this record. The dutch trio melds together electronic and indie pop together to create dreamy landscape, filled with songs with slow-burns. This album opens strongly with the meloncholy instrumental track “Doolhof” with ringing guitars and plenty of bass, setting the scene for the rest of the album. “Hostage” is this amazing slow-burn track starting off as a modest alt-pop with subtle guitar and electronic drum kit before evolving into an expansive dream-pop climax. “Island” perfectly closes out the record with another slow build up, starting with a catchy beat and vocal melody while constantly building on the current song. Before you know it, you find yourself surrounded by synths and echoing guitars. This album remains a classic for me, and honestly a pretty cool find for this just being my first official list.</p>

<section id="angel-olsen-my-woman" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="angel-olsen-my-woman">7. Angel Olsen: MY WOMAN</h2>
<p>MY WOMAN is the record I discovered the artist that would become one of absolute favorite artists, Angel Olsen. This album follows the absolutely amazing “<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/62RDt42wD8VdrhfHG6IzpC?si=74W4z9mlRg-q9Dqk1dCGvQ">Burn Your Fire For No Witness</a>”, which by in large was Angel Olsen’s breakout hit, and really outdoes herself. The album starts off with this incredible “Intern”, containing nothing but a synth and Angel’s iconic voice, before transitioning into the almost rockabilly “Never Mine”. If this album really demonstrates anything, its Angel’s ability to craft a well paced tracklist, with the front end filled with singles (including the lead single “Shut Up Kiss Me”), with the back end containing more B-side tracks like the dreamy “Those Were the Days”. The track “Sister” remains as one Angel’s best songs, with the front half containing a relaxed ballot that Fleetwood Mac would have been proud of, before building to a soaring guitar solo. This was a statement from Angel, not only in that she has the ability to change up her sound, but that she was going to be one of the most consistent songwriters in music.</p>

<section id="wilco-schmilco" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wilco-schmilco">6. Wilco: Schmilco</h2>
<p>Anyone who knows me knows that Wilco is my favorite band. So any review I write about them should probably be taken with a grain of salt. That being said, this album is criminally underrated in the Wilco catalog. This album only came a year after the well received “<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5yHC5HGL7CbdbzgqSzuaoP?si=F42eW_n0RNC485X5WZKqrw">Star Wars</a>” (an album title that was meant stir up a lawsuit that never materialized), containing tons of fun songs with fuzzy guitars, loose arrangements, and lackadaisical vocals from Jeff Tweedy. “Schmilco” follows a completely opposite formula, with tight arrangements, a minimalist approached, and some of Jeff’s most introspective lyrics to date. The album opens with “The Normal American Kids”, only featuring an acoustic guitar with lead electric flourishes and Jeff’s voice, exploring his frustration as an and drug use as an adolescent. “If I was Ever a Child” is reminiscent of the alt-country ascetic of “Being There”. “Locator” is an experimentation into a minimalist noise rock song, giving the album some sonic range. I love the very simple guitar/piano melody and almost whispered vocals on “Shrug and Destroy” that just set this wonderful hushed mood. Anything Wilco releases will immediately be compared to there legendary works from the late 1990s into the 2000s, which I think does a disservice to the albums individually. Turns out, even if a record isn’t a band’s best work, if you are as talented as Wilco, its still going to be pretty damn good.</p>

<section id="keaton-henson-kindly-now" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="keaton-henson-kindly-now">5. Keaton Henson: Kindly Now</h2>
<p>Words cannot describe how fragile and bleak this album is. Henson gained a cult following on is fantastic debut “<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/11gZYT85Mx4aSiHthMYLLQ?si=nqKiqDxYSvyFKRRw92R9Dg">Dear</a>”, that contained largely guitar only tracks like “You Don’t Know How Lucky You Are”. Here, Henson opts for more piano driven tracks, bulstered by orchestral sections. Keaton Henson writes a truly beautiful song that can be difficult to get through. Much of the lyrical content is centered around a particularly painful break up and missing this person. The “Pugilist” starts similar to tracks on “Dear” before growing into the much larger sound that you come to expect from the rest of the album On “Alright” Henson talks about how he’s managing without this person, or lamenting losing this person on the closing track “How Could I Have Known”, that swells into emotional orchestral finale. This album is filled a lot of pain, but for those who can stand it, or those who just want bawl their eyes out, there is a lot of beauty to be found.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="margaret-glaspy-emotions-and-math">4. Margaret Glaspy: Emotions and Math</h2>
<p>On paper, this album is quite simple, just 1 guitar, 1 bass, 1 drummer, and 1 vocalist. Yet, this album is chock full of great tracks. The title track remains my favo</p>
