<p>I must say, this has been one of the strangest lists I’ve ever put together. I was just having a really difficult time finding music that was resonating with me in the first ~6 months of the year, with a few notable exceptions, which made me a bit nervous about the list. It’s possible that after creating what is probably my favorite list so far the previous year, I was dealing with a bit of a musical hangover. Still, I was finding throughout my typical musical sources/blogs that there was somewhat of a consensus that 2023 was just a weaker year of music. But now that I have made my list, I’m actually incredibly happy with how things came out. The second half of the year was jam packed with fantastic releases that really filled out the list. Additionally, years in which I’m having a more difficult time finding music tend to lead to me branching out a bit more into other genres, which make for more interesting lists (at least in my opinion). For the first time, I have two hip hop records in my top 10, which is a genre I’ve been trying to spend more time it.</p>
<p>I don’t think it helped that I was on the go a ton this year, traveling back and forth from New York City a lot this year, traveling to Aruba for a vacation that I was incredibly (so incredibly) fortunate to join my girlfriend’s family on, another summer of field work at Whiteface Mountain, and yet another extended trip to Colorado. This year is also setting up the end of my PhD, with my hopes of finishing up in August 2024, and permanently moving to New York. Seems anxieties of producing high quality work, whether it was my PhD or this list was somewhat of a theme this year. I’m very happy with how this list ended up and maybe it’s a sign for things to come.</p>

<section id="jessie-ware-that-feels-good" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="jessie-ware-that-feels-good">25. Jessie Ware: That! Feels Good!</h2>
<p>Sneaking into the list this year is the insanely fun disco/funk record from Jessie Ware. Jessie Ware really blew up in 2020 with a similar genre of dance music in 2020 with <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1CTm3ARqDETSm7GfvNYNJp?si=qum3K8NQQ7iY56cnNfGEAQ">What’s You Pleasure</a>, but for whatever reason I never really could get into it. On That! Feels Good!, she won me over with just the unadulterated joy found throughout the record. “Begin Again”, a favorite of the year for me is just fantastically put together song with the jangly guitars, piano lines matching the melody, and the prominent horns. Incredibly fun record.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="earl-sweatshirt-and-the-alchemist-voir-dire">24. Earl Sweatshirt and The Alchemist: Voir Dire</h2>
<p>Earl Sweatshirt is back with another fantastic project, teaming up with the Alchemist to produce a slow pace, yet often bright sounding record. I really like Earl’s flow on this record, the down tempo-ed approach is a nice contrast to the bright pianos on the track “Mancala”. “Vin Skully’s” beat is such an earmworm, with the simple blues guitar riff, before a super cool transition into “Sentry”. The track list coming in at 26 minutes, there is no excuse not to give this record a try.</p>

<section id="bully-lucky-for-you" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bully-lucky-for-you">23. Bully: Lucky for You</h2>
<p>I’m such a sucker for loud, powerchord driven indie-rock, so there was never going to be a world where I didn’t like this album. What stands out on this record is the fantastic lead vocals from Alicia Bognanno and the slight feedback from the guitars combined with synth lines to give each track more power. “A Wonderful Life” is a perfect example where the guitars are turned up to 11. We then transition into the best track on the album, “Hard To Love”, containing a ton of fuzzy guitars and feedback that just make this so badass. This is indie rock at its best.</p>

<section id="sufjan-stevens-javelin" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sufjan-stevens-javelin">22. Sufjan Stevens: Javelin</h2>
<p>Sufjan Stevens finally got me to like a whole album. For whatever reason, I have never quite gotten why so many people are so enamored with Sufjan Stevens, even understanding some of the incredibly personal and heavy topics is previous works have discussed. But on “Javelin”, I might be starting to get it. There are just some many beautiful moments throughout the record, whether its the children choir coming in towards the end of “Will Anybody Love Me” or the delicate approach to So You Are Tired; a song so delicate it might fall apart at the slightest touch. When the album released, Steven’s announced to the world the album was dedicated to his life partner who had recently passed away which just adds to the soul crushing nature to this album. A true work of art no one should miss out on.</p>

<section id="yeule-softscars" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="yeule-softscars">21. Yeule: softscars</h2>
<p>Perhaps one of the most unique albums I’ve heard this year comes from yeule, combining elements of rock and metal with glitch pop. I can help but get this idea in my head that this is “zoomer” music, music for gen z. But that probably makes me seem like an old man. The opening track “x w x” sets the stage perfectly for the rest of the record, with heavy guitars and a pretty amazing screamo-esque belt that fits just perfectly. “softscars” has this groovy beat and ringing digital soundscape to it that always has my head bopping along. This is a super unique listen and perhaps points to a sound we could hear more of in the future.</p>

<section id="boygenius-the-record" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="boygenius-the-record">20. Boygenius: The Record</h2>
<p>The famed sad-girl trio is back! Unfortunately, this album at times feels like a collection of B-Sides or spare songs from their respective solo careers. The good news? Terms out that the B-Sides of these stupendously talented songwriters still makes for a really good album. Interestingly, I find that Julien Baker really stands out on the record, the member I listen to least to. For instance “$20” kicks butt, with scratchy guitars and a powerful vocal delivery from Baker. There are some truly fantastic singles on this record, like the undeniable “Not Strong Enough”, whose chorus is just so amazingly catchy (especially when Bridgers and Baker go into their falsettos). I really like sincerity of “Cool About It”, as friends are unable to discuss an undisclosed problem/fight. Tons of great stuff here and it certainly will tide me over until the next project of one of these three.</p>

<section id="jeff-rosenstock-hellmode" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="jeff-rosenstock-hellmode">19. Jeff Rosenstock: Hellmode</h2>
<p>I’m always on the look out for a good pop-rock record as it’s a genre of music that holds a special place in my heart. This we have the excellent skaw/punk veteran, Jeff Rosenstock. While I’ve been aware of him for a while, this is the first time I have actually dug into a project of his. This album has everything essential for a punk record; loud guitars, catchy choruses, and tons of angst of unrest. “Will U Still U” is a strong start to the record with the refrain of “will you still love me after I fucked up” before the song picks up the pace with an almost speed metal-esque drum line that feeds into a fantastic sing-along chorus. “Head’ is a criminally too short track as Rosenstock explores so of the desperate political issues facing the United States that somehow manages to be a ton of fun. There is a ton of great stuff in here for any pop-punk fans out there. If this a genre you love, this is a must listen.</p>

<section id="jules-olson-heavy-hitter" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="jules-olson-heavy-hitter">18. Jules Olson: Heavy Hitter</h2>
<p>So this is the first time I’m actually getting the chance to review the album of a friend, which I think is pretty cool (hi Jules!). In her debut full length record, Jules skillfully combines soul, singer-songwriter, and folk that showcase some of her biggest musical influences including Pinegrove, John Mayer, and Allen Stone. “Solid Ground” has such a terrific instrumentation to that serves as a perfect pairing to a damn good vocal performance from Jules (the pedal steel in particular just works so well here). “Cold” is an instant classic, with a breezy vibe perfect for road trips in your car with nowhere in particular to be. There are some lovely acoustic tracks like “Good Thing” to give the album a melancholy yet cozy feeling to the album. Fantastic debut from Jules; give it a listen!</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="james-blake-playing-robots-into-heaven">17. James Blake: Playing Robots Into Heaven</h2>
<p>James Blake is really starting to become one of the more consistent artists for me in music right now. His early career stuff would always contain amazing tracks but he could never pull it off for entire record. But now Blake continues his excellent song writing form from albums like the excellent <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3VpbXPsAOhcp3duHhkye8g?si=ofREEAE9SrCc1AfK04Qedg">Assume Form</a> with “Playing Robots in Heaven”. This album serves as a late night EDM album, with danceable yet subdued beats, like on tracks like “Loading”. However, there are plenty of tracks that play to Blake’s strengths such as “Asking to Break” with the spacious beats, vocal effects, and his iconic voice. “Fire the Editor” is right up there with his very best tracks; a beautiful ballad that feels like a lullaby as much as anything. It’s also one of James Blake’s best vocal perfomances in his career. The album closes with a dreamy piano ballad and a hushed ambient track as if to represent the end of a night out. Another great project from an artist who is really growing on me.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="say-she-she-silver">16. Say She She: Silver</h2>
<p>You will have a hard time finding a more fun funk and soul record from this past year than Say She She’s “Silver”. This album is just chock full of jams that are guaranteed to have you bobbing you head alone. They waste no time with groovy “Reeling”, with incredibly fun rising falesseto vocals weaving in and out of the track. It doesn’t get anymore whimsical than the wonderfully silly “Astral Plane” as they hope to meet their lover on another plane of existence (hint, its the Astral Plane). This is a track that has been on repeat a lot since the album dropped in October (and a great soundtrack for my bike rides to work in Colorado). “Think About About It” has a verse that Khruangbin would have been proud of that I find just so delightful. The album runs a bit long with 16 tracks coming in at 1 hour and 6 minutes, but their just so many gems on this record that it’s hard to blame them for including as many tracks as they did. An perfect album to put you in a great mood.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="jungle-volcano">15. Jungle: Volcano</h2>
<p>Probably the only album that was able to out-groove Say She She. I really enjoyed Jungles <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3xuvOKpNqynROqZt8Tvcfh?si=MJVIUEJ1SIu8_LfzuQ5S8Q">Loving in Stereo</a>, contain tons alternative funk tracks and a favorite song of mine from 2021, “Romeo”. They return an excellent follow up on “Volcano”, with a stylistic change opting for more female vocals with lush harmonies and use of horns and flute that take their sound to another level. This album is just a banger after banger of energetic disco and funk tracks. “Dominoes” was an instant hit with me with an incredibly infectious guitar line that just gets stuck in my head. The playful vocals add to the vibe and just love how the layered vocal harmonies on the second chorus sound. Such a cool moment on the track. “Back on 74” sounds like a Gorillaz Plastic Beach era song if they decided to add doowop vocals ot the track, making for another great highlight on the record. They album contains a bunch really fun features like Channel Tre on “I’ve Been in Love” or Bas on “Pretty Little Thing” to add something a little different throughout the album. Another incredibly fun record for a fun band.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wilco-cousin">14. Wilco: Cousin</h2>
<p>As with any Wilco album, I must disclose that Wilco is my all time favorite band and really can’t do much wrong in my eyes. Still, I truly think this a yet another fantastic release from the veteran band. There was a lot of great stuff on their previous release <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5prfZewHLWnEMaWdDdgEb5?si=TGdUgCuKRPOGM6t7JMXg3Q">Cruel Country</a>, but had too many mediocre tracks due to the attempt at a double album On “Cousin”, they cut out the fluff to make an album that I think of as almost a sister album to the cult classic <strong>A Ghost is Born</strong>. While maybe not as experimental as their most acclaimed works, their are great production moments and band adjusts throughout the album. Like on “Infinite Surprise”, the ticking clock adds a certain tension to track before it finally goes to the background as the whole band comes in. On “Evicted”, the track starts off as what seems like simple Jeff Tweedy track acoustic track, but layered guitars start filtering into the track and by the end have you wondering how you got there. “A Bowl of Pudding” reminds a little bit of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3AJwzV9YlIn8PfxDnEGApp?si=b11a63fe3fa04cff">Muzzle of Bees</a> with its echoing acoustic finger picking and delicate vocals from Jeff Tweedy. “Pittsburgh” is the major highlight on the record for me, as it transitions in and out of a simple acoustic track into a explosion of guitar feedback and synths. Wilco continue to show that they aren’t just a Dad rock band of the past but continue to have fresh ideas to contribute to world of music.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="geese-3d-country">13. Geese: 3D Country</h2>
<p>Despite it’s fairly straightforward sound, “3D Country” has been such a difficult album for me to put my finger on. At first, I wasn’t even sure I liked it but I kept finding myself coming back to it. At times, record feels like a relic of the past, a soft rock album that probably would have been popular in the 70s. Yet the album also feels out of control and insane, largely due to some undeniable vocal performances from Cameron Winter like on the title track or “See Myself”. The album starts big on the badass “2122”, with Winter’s vocals alternating with some southern rock guitar riffs. But they pivot sounds all the time on the record. The title track has such a wonderful vocal melody backed by some almost gospel harmonies that give the song so much charm. So many of the songs on the album Geese just absolutely goes for it, like on the energetic Undoer or Mysterious love. This has honestly been a fairly tough album to write a review about as I still don’t know quite to make of the band. There is one thing that I know for sure; this is a damn good album from a damn good band.</p>

<section id="shame-food-for-worms" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="shame-food-for-worms">12. Shame: Food for Worms</h2>
<p>Shame are back with another fantastic punk/post-punk/indie rock record filled with tons of emotion. I really enjoyed the hectic but sincere <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3ZtngTnZwbWMAdzcpKWgXH?si=9xZ_ec9wR7WVImXKkpDm0Q">Songs of Praise</a>, particularly tracks like “Concrete” and “One Rizla”. Here they return with “Food for Worms”, backing off just slightly from their punk sound in favor of a more indie rock sound. Despite this change, they didn’t lost an ounce of the sincerity that made previous work so special. There is the great optimism to the opening track “Fingers of Steel” despite a more downbeat lyrical content of regretting the circumstances that a person has found themselves in. The vocals from Charlie Steen are perfect; he’s not a classically trained singer by any means, but they rough around the edges approach to the vocals are a critical part of what makes Shame, well Shame. Steen is capable of great belting like on tracks like on “Alibis” but is capable of more tender moments like on the best track on the record “Orchid”. I love the lower energy the song start with before it finally ends with an army of guitars and heavy bass to bring the song home. Such a great moment on the record. “Adderall” has this great sing-along quality to the chorus with the call and response vocals from the Steen and the band. It honestly so sweet sounding for a song about adderall. The album closes stellarly with “All the People”, serving as a perfect way to close the record. This album got a ton of love from the indie community upon release, and completely get it. There’s just so much to get behind on this album.</p>

<section id="blonde-redhead-sit-down-for-dinner" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="blonde-redhead-sit-down-for-dinner">11. Blonde Redhead: Sit Down for Dinner</h2>
<p>Just missing out on the top 10 is the lovely “Sit Down for Dinner” from Blonde Redhead. Despite putting out music since the 90s, this is the first project that I have listened from this group; and it’s a wonderful introduction. There is this great mystique that shrouds over the album that I just find so intriguing. The album strikes a great balance between dream-pop and indie rock aesthetics as the veteran musicians show have shown they honed their craft. I think part of that is down to what I find is excellent production. I love the slight reverb thrown on just about every sound that you hear on the album, but without over-saturating things to the point where you can’t distinguish any of the sounds. I also enjoy that the lead singers alternate each track, keeping the album from sounding stale at any point. I think the album works best consumed all together, but that prevent so fantastic singles like on “Not For Me”. I find the vocal melody so beautiful coupled with the acoustic guitar, subtle background vocal harmonies, and echoing lead guitars. The excellent “Melody Experiment” quickly follows, with these great woozy guitars and subtle noises added into the background, making for a really interesting listening experience. There are some proper B-Side tracks on the album that are bit slower but add greatly to the character of the album, like “I Thought You Should Know” that feels like it could be a song in the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chariots_of_Fire">Chariots of Fire</a>. “Via Savona” gently closes the album with much of the same dreamy soundscapes that made this album great. This album grew a lot on me with repeated listens and is best listened to with a good set of headphones. Give this record a spin, especially late at night.</p>

<section id="jolie-holland-haunted-mountain" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="jolie-holland-haunted-mountain">10. Jolie Holland: Haunted Mountain</h2>
<p>If there was one word I would use to describe this album, it would be “Magic”. There are just some artists that inexplicably take a relatively sparse sound and just make it so special; my first thoughts are people like I <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6meH4I9A4WZtD3z8hnQKqr?si=1a335c6e29fa407c">Nick Drake</a> or <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4hJEhCACCeA8U4CyTP4BDw?si=f455853195954f7f">Angel Olsen</a> who just capture this magic like no other. “Haunted Mountain” is filled with songs like this. The release of the album was also right in the middle of fall and I can think of few better cold weather companions than this record. I think a big part of the magic of this album comes from the weary vocals from Holland, symbolic of a 2 decades long music career that add a layer of genuineness to each track that is hard to imitate. “2000 Miles” is a perfect opener for the album and a truly beautiful track as it opens with the devastating line “I couldn’t sing a high note, or put on my shoes, without remembering you”. There is such an expert use of space on just about every one of this tracks, with the sparest alt-country and americana band arrangements that bring Holland’s words to the front of every song. “Highway 72” features a comfy duet with a musical hero of mine, Buck Meek of Big Thief. There is some much chemistry between the two that you would have thought they have been life long friends. The title track is subtle country ballad that I can easily imagine Jolie Hollarnd playing in some middle of nowhere western bar. “Orange Blossoms” is a dark track, pointing out that that mother nature will be here whether humans are here or not. I really love how Holland closes the record on “What It’s Worth”. The song is a bit dreamier than the rest of the help, with the hushed strumming of rhythm guitar with a single notes being plucked from the lead guitar. After finding this album, I plan to do a deep dive into Jolie Holland’s discography as I haven’t found a singer-songwriter who has resonated with me like this in quite a while.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="everything-is-alive-slowdive">9. Everything is Alive: Slowdive</h2>
<p>I find it pretty cool that a veteran group like Slowdive can take an extended, 2+ decade long hiatus, and then return making some of the best music of their career. Their previous <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1qDA0jVhj4ZTjGHmpbmmwa?si=IUc4bsOGSUyKhFDUc_JFNA">self titled record</a>, was an incredible dream-pop/shoegaze record that rivals almost everything Beach House have put out, and I’m adamant <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0eVz3hV2xOXdneGpnWDFpb?si=b3f340428e8847ac">Sugar for the Pill</a> is one of the best songs of the 2010s. The group returns with the excellent “Everything is Alive”. Slowdive don’t stray too far away from their sound much on this record but still manage to keep this record distinct from their previous works to prevent things from going stale. “shanty” opens the album strongly, with the pulsating synth line, distorted guitars, and some a super cool use of harpsichord. “prayer remembered” is a methodical instrumental fill as each instrument takes its turn fading in and out of the track. They pick up the pace with,“alife” is a track reminiscent of “Star Rover” containing these great cascading guitars on the chorus, and is a real highlight on the album. Far and away the best track on the album is “kisses’, the lead single, with a lead guitar part that always finds a way to get stuck in your. This song is absolutely perfect for late night driving. Their are other dreamy shoegaze on the album like”skin in the game” that has this amazing tapestry of guitars, especially on the backend of track, or the urgent sounding “the slab. These guys have been making music like this for a long time now and rather rest on their laurels, continue to put out fantastic dream pop records. Check this record out with (like all of there other work) with a good set of headphones, late at night.</p>

<section id="andy-shauf-norm" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="andy-shauf-norm">8. Andy Shauf: Norm</h2>
<p>Andy Shauf has done it again with another fantastic narrative album that is quite a bit darker than sweet <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/41M6R2mWLgqU9aKFUvZv8S?si=Sf-9Iz0hRqCyrzIEWcqEqQ">The Neon Skyline</a>. I must admit, I this album took some time for me to come around. I was more expecting the lush chamber pop arrangements on the incredible <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/35FWLG8Ysjj1BF3sx4F6zM?si=8jdLTYMoQN-RpH6V5umK9g">The Party</a> or the fun acoustic story telling on the Neon Skyline. But here, Shauf changes his style, with arrangements that are while beautiful, feel just a bit off. But once I dug into the lyrics further it all clicked. “Norm” follows the story of, well Norm, as his love for a girl turns to an unhealthy obsession. We start the record with the prolixly arranged “Wasted on You” from the perspective of (presumably) God, worrying that all of the love he shares with humanity is going to waste, before we are introduced to our protagonist, Norm. Norm is day dreaming on “Catch Your Eye” hoping that he gets a chance of random encounter with the woman he loves. He begins to stalk her, calling her telephone but finding himself unable to speak. God tries to steer Norm clear of these “wicked ways” by speaking to him in his dreams but to no avail. On the eerily beautiful “Sunset”, Norm finally gets his chance, running into his love at a Halloween store, with the two hitting it off, before she comes out to the parking lot to find her car is missing. To her own demise, accepts the ride and uncomfortably asks “are we leaving the city” and Norm asks her “where did your phone go?”, never to be seen again (with the body count in the Shauf’s music catelog to 6). The song is made creepier by the phrase “this isn’t the end” being repeated. The album closes with a couple of tracks explaining that an ex of the ill-fated woman was a tow-trunk driver and towed her truck the day she was kidnapped. Norm (the record) is another amazing example of Shauf’s knack for unique and impactful storytelling. Like many other artists I love, his songs are often great than the sum of their parts, including the simplicity in most of the stories he writes. These traits in his songwriting make him unique and it should be no surprise a major reason why he is one of my all time favorite songwriters.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="billy-woods-kenny-segal-maps">7. Billy Woods &amp; Kenny Segal: Maps</h2>
<p>Billy Woods has been on my radar for a little while now as one of the biggest names in underground rap and is just adored in basically every online music community I’m aware. I finally decided to give him a close listen and I’m now asking myself what took so long. Here, Woods teams up again with the producer Kenny Segal following up their previous beloved collaboration <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0HmKhR7Umt3ACs52ZLnKyK?si=UQrNts0MQHGX1vvXSJTnUA">Hiding Places</a> to create one of the best hip hop records of the year on “Maps”. There is this amazing sluggishness to the majority beats throughout the album which works so well with Woods cadence and flow. It honestly amazes me how much Billy Woods can his flow with the downtempo beats. The production throughout the record is fantastic. “Soft Landing” is my favorite track on the album, with the jangely guitars and heavy bass. The way Woods so nonchalantly asks about drinks before jumping right into the track is such a cool moment. With 17 tracks, this album could have felt like a drag, but with only 5 of the tracks lasting longer than 3 minutes, the record moves on before you have a chance to get bored. “Babylon Bus” is another highlight, starting pretty subdued before building tension with a great feature from ShrapKnel, that finally erupts with strings and horns. This song then transitions sublimely into “Year Zero”, containing a crazy Danny Brown (who seemed to be showing up everywhere this…). The lyricism throughout this album is honestly so abstract that just about every track requires thorough listening to fully digest what is being said. Despite the down tempo production found on this record, there are some lighter moments like on tracks like on “Facetime”, with a great hook from Samuel T. Herring, or the jazz flute on “Waiting Around” (with a great feature from Aesop Rock). I feel like I’m going to continue to find things in this albums that I didn’t notice before for the months to come. Any hip hop fans should spend a long time with this record, because there is a ton to digest.</p>

<section id="wednesday-rat-saw-god" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wednesday-rat-saw-god">6. Wednesday: Rat Saw God</h2>
<p>My introduction to Wednesday is a kick-ass one with “Rat Saw God”. The 5 indie-rock/garage rock band has produced a collection of 11 songs that are about as vulnerable as you’ll hear from this past year. The first thing that you noticed (and what immediately peaked my interest) is just how loud this record is. They combine all kinds of genres of rock from punk to noise rock to grundge with even some slight country twang with the inclusion of pedal steel (which might be a growing trend in music pointed out by Jonah Krueger at <a href="https://consequence.net/2023/10/pedal-steel-country-indie-mitksi-wednesday/3/">Consequence of Sound</a>, which is a welcome development for me). Beyond the instrumentation is the subject matter, telling stories of drug and alcohol addiction/abuse throughout. A perfect example is on the truly excellent (and one of the best songs of the year) “Bull Believer”, as the first half of the song describes the horrors watching someone you love fall to addiction. The second half invokes of a shitty relationship, watching your boyfriend play Mortal Combat as you sit with a nosebleed, before just erupting into a huge cacophony of guitars, as the lead singer Karly Hartzman belts “Finish Him” that collapses into pure primal screaming (best vocal performance of the year). “Chosen to Deserve” a Drive-By Truckers inspired track (Hartzman told Apple Music) that tells the story of Hartman’s friends taking Benadryl to get high, before one of the friends too much and had to get their stomach pumped. I find the framing of this song interesting, using this story as a “take me as I am, warts and all” and is thankful she is “the girl you have chosen to deserve” to this person. There are so many times that album just goes for it with guitars like on “Bath Country” or “Quarry”. I really like closing track “TV in the Gas Pump” a great way to close the album as the band steps back from the louder for a more laid back rock sound. I find it a nice way to ease out of what, at times, can feel can be an a pretty intense album. This is a truly phenomenal rock record that demands repeated listening.</p>
