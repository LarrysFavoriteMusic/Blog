A new president was elected, vaccines for COVID-19 were distributed, the world began opening up again and during the fall, I moved to Boulder Colorado from September to December. This list was probably one of my less experimental years of music, with a fantastic year for women in music (9 out 10 artists in the top 10 and 18 of the top 25 albums were female artists or bands led by women)."

I wrote\n\nMy First List\nApproaching finals week, I unsurprisingly was finding myself in the library quite frequently either studying or working on final class projects. I was looking for something to help things bit more bearbile. It then I stumbled on to two different music outlets. The first was the website Album of the Year. Album of the year is social network/blog type website not dissmilar to sites like Rate Your Music. However, an important difference here is that also as a database for both reviews for critics and users of the website. Since it was early December, we were in “list season”; where major publications release their lists for the top albums of the year. Album of the year was also compiling this information to create an average albums of the year list.\nThe second outlet is from an NPR podcast that I had already been regularly listening to for about year at this point; All Songs Considered. A wonderful music podcast hosted by Bob Boilen (the same person who created Tiny Desk Concerts) and Robin Hilton. They had just released a pod discussing listener picks for the best albums of the year. For whatever reason, I found (and still find this…) fascinating. This got me thinking about what my favorite albums of the past year were. I then wrote down some 30 albums, and listened to each one during finals week and picked my 10 favorites. I h\n\n\nGoing Forward\nThis project is here for 3 major purpose:\n\nCompile all of my lists and playlists into one place for ease of access\nImprove coding and writing skills with a website/pseudoblog project\nMake it easier to share my favorite music with a potentially larger audience\n\nI"

The music quality in 2016 was just amazing, with amazing albums I don’t cover here that include (and are not limited to) David Bowie’s final record “Blackstar”, Anderson Paak’s “Malibu”, Frank Ocean’s “Blonde”, Pinegrove’s “Cardinal”, and Deerhoof’s “The Magic” (which remains my favorite album of theirs from a very long and impressive catalog). The albums that are on this list still find their way into my listening queues on fairly regular basis. I also didn’t make a top songs playlist to accompany the album list so I’ll name a handful tracks that remain favorites to me, but tracks that really stand out to me from this year include:\nPlus tons of other songs, some of which I feature in this list.

The album is full of introspective lyrics like on “I Don’t Wanna Be Funny”, which talks about her wanting to be more than just a funny person. But as far as I’m concerned, Lucy’s biggest strength is her soothing voice, which enhances her words. “Map on the Wall” serves as a nice slow burn track, helping to fill out the rest of the album. All in all, a really great debut.\n\nKey Tracks: Green Eyes, Red Face, Map on the Wall"

This record is filled with lush strings and subtle beats, topped off with Ry Cuming’s gentle vocals. In particular, “Howling” has this simple little bit and yet does so much to make the song an earworm. “Berlin” remains a super hit for this artist (179 million streams on spotify) and probably the best vocal performance on the record as Ry’s voice matches the guitar note for note in the background. A true highlight is the gorgeous “Beacon” led by the an orchestral string section the builds with guitars and percussion in the background. This album serves as a perfect late-night companion, and one that likely will find myself spending time with in the future.\n\nKey Tracks: Beacon, Howling"

The dutch trio melds together electronic and indie pop together to create dreamy landscape, filled with songs with slow-burns. This album opens strongly with the meloncholy instrumental track “Doolhof” with ringing guitars and plenty of bass, setting the scene for the rest of the album. “Hostage” is this amazing slow-burn track starting off as a modest alt-pop with subtle guitar and electronic drum kit before evolving into an expansive dream-pop climax. “Island” perfectly closes out the record with another slow build up, starting with a catchy beat and vocal melody while constantly building on the current song. Before you know it, you find yourself surrounded by synths and echoing guitars. This album remains a classic for me, and honestly a pretty cool find for this just being my first official list.\n\nKey Tracks: Hostage, Island"

This album follows the absolutely amazing “Burn Your Fire For No Witness”, which by in large was Angel Olsen’s breakout hit, and really outdoes herself. The album starts off with this incredible “Intern”, containing nothing but a synth and Angel’s iconic voice, before transitioning into the almost rockabilly “Never Mine”. If this album really demonstrates anything, its Angel’s ability to craft a well paced tracklist, with the front end filled with singles (including the lead single “Shut Up Kiss Me”), with the back end containing more B-side tracks like the dreamy “Those Were the Days”. The track “Sister” remains as one Angel’s best songs, with the front half containing a relaxed ballot that Fleetwood Mac would have been proud of, before building to a soaring guitar solo. This was a statement from Angel, not only in that she has the ability to change up her sound, but that she was going to be one of the most consistent songwriters in music.\n\nKey Tracks: Sister, Never Be Mine, Shut Up Kiss Me"

    "text": "6. Wilco: Schmilco\nAnyone who knows me knows that Wilco is my favorite band. So any review I write about them should probably be taken with a grain of salt. That being said, this album is criminally underrated in the Wilco catalog. This album only came a year after the well received “Star Wars” (an album title that was meant stir up a lawsuit that never materialized), containing tons of fun songs with fuzzy guitars, loose arrangements, and lackadaisical vocals from Jeff Tweedy. “Schmilco” follows a completely opposite formula, with tight arrangements, a minimalist approached, and some of Jeff’s most introspective lyrics to date. The album opens with “The Normal American Kids”, only featuring an acoustic guitar with lead electric flourishes and Jeff’s voice, exploring his frustration as an and drug use as an adolescent. “If I was Ever a Child” is reminiscent of the alt-country ascetic of “Being There”. “Locator” is an experimentation into a minimalist noise rock song, giving the album some sonic range. I love the very simple guitar/piano melody and almost whispered vocals on “Shrug and Destroy” that just set this wonderful hushed mood. Anything Wilco releases will immediately be compared to there legendary works from the late 1990s into the 2000s, which I think does a disservice to the albums individually. Turns out, even if a record isn’t a band’s best work, if you are as talented as Wilco, its still going to be pretty damn good.\n\nKey Tracks: If I Ever Was A Child, Locator, Shrug and Destroy"

Henson gained a cult following on is fantastic debut “Dear”, that contained largely guitar only tracks like “You Don’t Know How Lucky You Are”. Here, Henson opts for more piano driven tracks, bulstered by orchestral sections. Keaton Henson writes a truly beautiful song that can be difficult to get through. Much of the lyrical content is centered around a particularly painful break up and missing this person. The “Pugilist” starts similar to tracks on “Dear” before growing into the much larger sound that you come to expect from the rest of the album On “Alright” Henson talks about how he’s managing without this person, or lamenting losing this person on the closing track “How Could I Have Known”, that swells into emotional orchestral finale. This album is filled a lot of pain, but for those who can stand it, or those who just want bawl their eyes out, there is a lot of beauty to be found.\n\nKey Tracks: Holy Lover, Alright, I Should Have Known"

    "text": "This was a very significant year of change for me. I graduated from SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry in May 2018, and started my Ph.D in atmospheric sciences at the University of Albany a couple of weeks later. It seems fitting this was the year I decided switch up the format for the album of the list. If there was one year I could pick to redo a list for, it’s probably this one. I decided on choosing 40 albums rather than 10 or 25 as there was just a ton of albums I really liked that year that I wanted to represent in some way. Look back now, I was right; there are just a ton of albums that I enjoy that year. However, 40 was probably a few too many as there are a handful of albums that haven’t aged well for me. I would probably reshuffle the Top 10 pretty significantly as well. Albums like Low’s hauntingly beautiful and experimental “Double Negative” or Beach House’s subperb “7” probably deserve to be higher up on this list, while albums like Lucy Dacus’s “Historian” or the fun hot mess that is Anderson.Paak’s “Oxnard” probably should be lower on the list. Still, 2018 had a lot of music I really loved, and I often associate with graduation. It’s hard not to look back at this list with nostalgia."

This trio includes Amelia Meath of Slyvan Esso, Molly Sarlé, and Alexandra Sauser-Monnig of Daughter of the Swords, all who attended Bennington College together. Together, they produce a master class in minimalistic traditional and indie folk, opting for nothing more than simple acoustic guitar parts and their amazing vocal harmonies. Tracks like “Whale Song” and “Bright Morning Stars” use space perfectly to really necessitate their siren like vocal harmonies. The incredibly cozy and comforting, “Slow Wake Up Sunday Morning” is true highlight from this record, that is only made better in the context of the full album."

I found “Pure Comedy” to be a very frustrating album, containing some of FJM’s very best song writing, but often overshadowed by preachy and pretentious tracks (Leaving La being 11 minutes of just acoustic guitar…). “God’s Favorite Customer” was a pleasant surprise for me, with FJM returning to the vulnerability and lush instrumentation that made 2015’s “I Love You, Honeybear” so fantastic."

We had been hearing stuff on the news about COVID, but didn’t think things would get too bad. When I arrive at work, i find out that if I had shown up a day later, they weren’t going to let me in the building. A few days, we get the “go home for 2 weeks” instruction. A week later I packed my car back to go home, and not leave really leave home for a long time. To make things worse, the presidential election became an utter shit show, with election “night” stretching into election week. With all this in the background, this made for an odd year of music for me. I find that this list is a more melancholy or experimental than other years, which probably matches how I felt at the time. Still, despite all of the awfulness that came out of this year, I did manage to find some truly great music."

Over time, this album continued to grew on me, and while not on the same level as “Twin Fantasy” or “Teens of Denial”, its still a great record.

The highlight of the album is “Hannah Sun” that starts with some simple strumming of an acoustic guitar with some synth for effect and slowly builds in volume only to fade away once again leaving just Lomelda and her guitar. Still, this album has moments of bigger sound like on the delightful “Wonder”, or a “Reach”, which sounds like it belongs on Weezer’s “Blue Album”, right after Undone.

Yet, you have the lo-fi production surrounding the songs, making for a truly eerie listening experience. The halloween-esq “I Want You To Suffer” begins with this almost Scooby Doo vibe to it before descending into pure distortion and feed back that is honestly quite unsettling, before coming back into focus. The following track has this 1940s song quality to it, but feels like it’s being played on a broker radio playing in another room. The album closes on it’s best track, “Heavy Metal”, sharing a similar oldies song style to it, but has this infectious guitar riff, a swelling string section, and a sweet choir of vocals, ending an album that at times can be quite abrasive, on a beautiful note."

Compared to previous works that had Nick’s vocals under tons of reverb, his voice feels more out in front with beautiful arrangements that compliment this so nicely. My favorite song on the record “Gods Dirty Work” has this amazing contrast between a strummed acoustic and a silky smooth lead guitar that just play off each other in way that I’m just in love with. The peaceful “Whoo” with a subtle flute notes towards the end, providing a perfect way to close this album. A great companion for relaxing evening.\n\nKey Tracks: Gods Dirty Work, Qadir, Whoo"

I love the technically proficient and yet deliberately off beat screeching guitar on “Sympathy for the Baby Boo” or the climbing scales in “Farewell Symphony” that descend into pure chaos in the second half of the record. “O Ye Saddle Babes” stands out has this fun, funky song, that almost feels dancable.

It was released very suddenly in late September, as we approached the first dark winter of COVID for the U.S. and we were in the middle of the clusterfuck that was the 2020 presidential election. In short, things were scary and tense. The world needed (or at least I believe the world needed) this record. “Shore” feels like a sister album to the fantastic (and slightly underrated if you ask me) “Crack Up”. However, rather than the grandiose songwriting that can make the approaching the project a bit daunting, on “Shore” the Fleet Foxes simplified things to allow songs to work better on their own, and to wonderful effect. This is just this bright optimism on songs like “Sunblind” that filled me with comfort. “Featherweight” is a standout track on the record, open with plucky acoustic guitar and an almost sea-faring vibe to it. As all Fleet Foxes albums, their are layered harmonies, folk acoustics that border on medieval aesthetics , and the undeniably melodic lead vocals from Robin Pecknold. I’m not sure I’ve ever had an album that came at such a perfect time in my life more than this and it’s hard not to come back to this album with the exact same feeling.\n\nKey Tracks: Sunblind, Featherweight, Can I Believe You"

Sarah Tudzin illuminati hotties released a really fun power pop/indie rock record in 2018, so I was interested to find out that this project was releasing a new album. However, this is no typical follow record, really considered more of a mixtape. At its core, this album is a punk album, filled with great production and biting lyrics. “Freed Ppls” is this almost speed metal like track that hits hard and collapses into chaos. “Content//Bedtime” is the describes the all too real feeling of a having a day being filled with just work then bed (probably a little to well…). Another striking thing about this record is it’s brevity, coming in at a very quick 23 minutes with only 1 song lasting longer than 2 and half minutes. Despite much of the album being recorded before the pandemic, the lyrics on “Free Dumb” reading “there was no love lost until you demand that I was non-essential” hits much harder in the context of 2020. And yet, it feels as if you get a full album experience. The closing track is a nice way to close out feelings of anger and anxiety, with Sarah thinking of things about loved ones that make her happy. This mixtape may not be the one we were supposed to wait for, but it’s hard to deny that something truly special was made here.\n\nKey Tracks: Free Ppls, Content/Bedtime, Melatonezone, Superiority Complex (Big Noise)"

This album is only about 34 minutes, and yet there is so much characterization throughout, whether it’s talking about reincarnation on “Dust Kids” or on the lounge-room like “Living Room” where a mother laments her acting like her father toward her own kid. Andy Shauf’s voice serves as a perfect narrator, providing a pleasant tone that doesn’t distract the story telling throughout the song. I’m just not aware of other artists that can capture the intimacy of relate able situations quite like Andy. The album closes perfectly with “Changer”, where the protagonist and his ex are just catching up talking about how the met and what brought them back to town, enveloped with a sweet but simple guitar part and Andy’s distinct clarinets. You truly feel like you have lived through this experience, and all in just 34 minutes.\n\nKey Tracks: Living Room, Changer, Try Again, The Neon Skyline"

This just struck a perfect emotional chord with me. There is also just a truly amazing number of amazing songs. “Kyoto” is this fun ( well at least sonically) song with a memorable trumpet part to the track and chorus that’s just begging you to scream-sing along. “Saviors Complex” has this incredible melody that I can’t help but hum along with every time it comes on. “ICU” has the slow burn to it that builds to the amazing final chorus and has the great lyric ’I hate your mom, I hate when she opens her mouth. It’s amazing to me how much you can say when you don’t know what your talking about” The albums ends with the truly cathartic finale on “I Know the End”, ending with Phoebe just screaming, which was just such a relateable feeling at the time. The album inevitably launched Phoebe into stardom, and it’s just such a cool thing to see, as this is an artist I had heard of since college, before her full-length debut.
