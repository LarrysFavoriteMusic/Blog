    "text": "Well fuck that year. Looking back at my 2024 blog writeup, there was a clear anxiety for the year that was to come, and while it wasn’t necessarily what I expected, that anxiety seemed broadly warranted. The year started off somewhat rough, with the Trump administration (illegally) cutting funding to grants and arbitrarily firing people from various agencies, making the funding landscape for science as whole incredibly uncertain. Come April, an impromptu meeting with leadership from NASA informed us that we were going to be removed from our office and instructed to work remote until further notice. This was coupled with constant threats of massive budget and an overall uncertainty our future as an agency of NASA as whole.\nIf that wasn’t fun enough, poor Karen has had an even tougher year, tearing her ACL on hike on her birthday week, requiring surgery (welcome to your 30s!). The recovery from that surgery has been challenging, particularly that first month or so. 0/10 would not recommend. They there is the intrusive threat of generative AI just sitting in the background, on top of just a rapidly degrading online experience. that has really been bugging me all year. I’m not going to go down a massive rabbit hole here, as I have a tendency to ruminate on this. All I’ll say on that front is this; slop being Merriam-Webster’s word of the year feels about right.\nBut not everything was horrible this year and think it’s important to take as much stock of good things in your life. I had a wonderful trip this past summer to Japan, a place I hope to return to in the not-to-distant future. Arsenal a really freaking good this year! (expect when they aren’t). In related news, I finally will getting the opportunity to see my beloved Arsenal in London right after the New Year against Liverpool.\nNeedless to say, it’s been a tough year. One thing I feel like I lost a little bit this year was a love music. Especially the first half the year, I just wasn’t finding myself connecting to a whole lot of things, which has legitimately been upsetting. I did wonder if perhaps the music offerings this year were not up to par, and but as I started to compile my list, I found this not to be the case. I did manage to find a number of things by the end of the year and create a list that I’m proud of. An perhaps most importantly, this is the 10th anniversary of my end of year lists! This all started with a way to not go insane studying for finals. Once I graduated, I promised myself to keep these lists going, as they serve as a time capsule for each year of my life and provide a wonderful catalog of music I can revisit. If you somehow stumbled on this blog; thanks for reading! Here’s to 10 more years."

Anyone who has followed this blog knows Andy Shauf is one of my main guys, so any review I give related to his works should be taken with a grain of salt. But I still think this an incredibly fun record, that was made more fun to listen after I saw them live a few months ago. “Listen2Me” has this groovy beat and pulsing synth lines, which erupt into life on the last minute of 30 seconds of the track. “Deadhead” is explicit permission from Shauf to not stop dancing, which always makes me giggle. “Round&Round” has such a catchy little guitar riff that gets very stuck in my head, forcing me to listen to again. Foxwarren may not quite reach the heights of Shauf’s solo work, but that’s not really the point.\n\nKey Tracks: Listen2Me, Round&Round"

There is just something about how they approach pop-punk and indie-rock that puts them above most other groups. So naturally, I was quite excited to find they were releasing a new record. The title track is something that I have really connected to, with very simple and repetitive lines; “I thought I was getting better, but I’m back to where I started. And the straight line was a circle, yeah the straight line was a lie”. This is just such a relatable feeling where you are trying to improve yourself on anything from mental health to bad habits, where you feel like you made progress but then you slip up, making it feel like you have to start over. In an interview with the Guardian, Elizabeth Stokes (lead singer/songwriter) talks about her experience taking antidepressants helped with her anxiety, but ended up flattening her out emotions, as alluded to on “No Joy”, which I found to be an interestingly transparent and approachable discussion on taking care of your mental health. While Straight Line Was A Lie doesn’t have the same power-chord driven rock that we have come to expect from The Beths, this record includes some of there most incisive writing to date.\n\nKey Tracks: Straight Line Was A Lie, Metal"

Car Seat Headrest - The Scholars\nJust missing out on the top 10 is from a long time favorite of mine, Car Seat Headrest. “The Scholars” was a welcome follow-up to their messy (though somewhat enjoyable) record, “Making A Door Less Open“. The album opens incredibly strongly with one of my favorite tracks of the year”CCF (I’m Going to Stay With You)” with its incredibly catchy chorus and ends with this super cool vocal round. “The Catastrophe (Good Luck With That, Man)” has the frantic energy, with the rapid acoustic guitar progressions towards the front of the track, and some just classic garage rock that we all know and love about Car Seat Headrest (plus finding a way to work in the phrase “ramalamadingdong”). Lead singer/songwriter, Will Toledo, has always been incredibly ambitious in his approach to songwriting, but not in sound but scope of his songs. This record is no exception with the B-side containing two 11 minute and one 19 minute songs right in a row. While each track doesn’t land perfectly, there is still so much to love within each of those track that practically serve as mini-albums themselves. While this band may never reach the heights of Twin Fantasy or Teens of Denial, this is a rock solid record to add to Car Seat Headrest’ss excellent catalog and should be welcome to any fan.\n\nKey Tracks: CCF (I’m Going to Stay With You), The Catastrophe (Good Luck With That, Man)"

Men I Trust - Equus Caballus\nIt was a big year for the minimalistic indie-pop group Men I Trust, releasing two records this year, Equus Caballus and Equus Asinus that are two-sides of the same coin. The former record is a bit more energetic and poppy compared to the later, though not dramatically slow. I have a hard time putting my finger on why exactly I love this record. Sonically nor lyrically, there isn’t anything particularly crazy going on nor is there a massive song diversity. And yet, I found myself drawn back to the record, even during periods where I didn’t find myself drawn to a whole lot. All I can conclude is that these are well written, performed, and produced songs with some sort of “secret sauce” that other groups can’t reproduce. “Come Back Down” has very vibes similar to Fleetwood Mac’s “Dreams”. I particularly love the subtle ring of the lead guitar on this track. “Ring of Past” is a super catchy pop track with a great bassline walk-up that always makes my head pop. “Billy Toppy” has this great urgency to it, with a vibration-ey or wobbley guitars. This review has been challenging to write, as the it isn’t very interesting to write “the vibes are good” 13 times. But they are. The vibes are good 13 times in a row. And that is exactly why I rank this album so highly.\n\nKey Tracks: Ring of Past, Come Back Down, Billy Topper"

Part of me wonders if I’ve outgrown his work a little bit; the moodiness that comes with records like For Emma, Forever Ago suited me better when I was younger, or the electronic experiments of 22, A Million were losing their charm. Still, Bon Iver is such an important figure in music that I gave it a chance, and I was immediately reminded of why I love his music so much. The record is split into two parts. The first few tracks are more stripped back, allowing Justin Vernon’s voice to shine through with minimal production. “AWARDS SEASON” is the highlight of first part of the album (and the album as a whole), starting with largely just Vernon’s vocals, before evolving to this truly beautiful horn section. The second section of the record comes back to the more produced elements of Bon Iver, but it I do find the production to be more stripped back compared to others projects. I love the dance between the piano and the vocal alterations that essentially serve as the beat to the song on “Day One”. Flock of Dimes has worked with Bon Iver in the past and their contributions are always a welcome surprised. “From” is the wonderful folk-pop song with a fantastic vocal performance from Vernon and some lovely vocal harmonies and guitar. Justin Vernon has strongly hinted this is his final record, at least as Bon Iver. If this is the case, I think this is fantastic bookend to a truly excellent musical career.\n\nKey Tracks: AWARDS SEASON, From, Day One"

Black Country, New Road - Forever Howlong\nI was so happy that I was able to enjoy the newest Black Country, New Road record. “Ants from Up There” was my album of the year in 2022 and very well may be my album of the decade. But the record’s release coincided with the lead singer Issac Woods, a major influence on their overall sound, leaving the band to tend to his mental health. This left the band in a somewhat tough spot, trying to redefine itself without an influential member; and I think think they have done so successfully. The group has stepped away from it’s post-punk roots in favor of more of a chamber-pop sound. Additionally, it feels as though there is more of a collective compared to their previous work; a real power of friendship type of connection. The arrangements of this record are both incredibly intricate and well thought out, but feel a bit rough around the arrangements that make the sound feel a lot more intimate, as if you are in the room with them. “Socks” is my personal favorite on the record, a bit of a slow-burn track that almost feels whimsical. “Happy Birthday” is another great track, with themes of marrying for wealth. I love the percussive vocal performance on the lines “How do you make it down the street? The city burns like fire beneath your feet”. “For the Cold Country” starts as a choral section before building towards a big finale that almost has a vaudeville feel to it. I was so encouraged to see this band land on its feet properly. It may not be the same band it was in 2022, but today’s version has so much to offer.\n\nKey Tracks: Socks, Happy Birthday, For the Cold Country"

On LUX, ROSALIA does exactly that, For starters, the albums contains 13 languages, ranging from Chinese, to German, to (of course) Spanish. In an interview with NPR, she talks about wanting to put the whole world into a record if she could, which feels immediately clear. This a clear sonic departure for ROSALÍA, with a unique mixture of orchestral and flamenco. “Sexo, Violencia, y Llantas” is stunning opener, essentially serving an opening to an opera. “Divinize” is my personal favorite, with a great vocal performance, with piano and string arrangements balancing some amazing production and booming electronic drumbeat in the background. There is this incredible transition between “Mio Cristo Piange Diamanti” and “Berghain”, where ROSALÍA hits this truly amazing note with her falsetto, before transitioning into this rapid and massive strings, coupled with a stunning a massive church choir. “Sauvignon Blac” is a beautiful love ballad and probably my favorite vocal performance on the record. This album is an absolute triumph and I imagine will win all kinds of awards and I am so here it for it.\n\nKey Tracks: Divinize, Dios Es Un Stalker, Sauvignon Blanc"

The subject matter and production are slow at times incredibly creepy. For instance, on “Waterproof Mascara”, a loop of a woman crying is front in center as Wood raps about domestic abuse and the impacts it had on him later in life. It is an incredibly unsettling listen. There are some amazing performances on this record, like the craziest flow from Bruiser Wolf on “BLK XMAS” as both artists talk about the struggles of poverty. I’m particularly struck lines talking about his disgust at a family being kicked out of their apartment on Christmas, but going through the stuff that was left behind. “Misery”, another wonderfully produced track, talking about a love-triangle with a vampire. The album gets more experimental with it’s horror themes towards the middle of the record, like on tracks like “Corinthians” and “Pitchforks and Halos”. “A Doll Fulla Pins” is another highlight, with it’s woozy beat and blaring saxophone as Woods raps about needing to look out for himself with lines like “can’t run with the wolves when you’re a stray”. This album is not an easy listen, but it is among the most essential listens from this past year.\n\nKey Tracks: BLK XMAS, Misery, A Doll Fulla Pins"

On “Bleeds”, they seem to lean heavier on their garage rock and grunge sounds, such as the opener “Reality TV Argument Bleeds”, hit you immediately with a mixture of fuzzy and bright guitars. “Townies” is a great encapsulation of returning to your home town, with all of the complicated feelings and relationships surrounding that, with heavy lines like “you sent my nudes around. I never yelled at you because you died”. But they best moment of the record is among the quietest: “Elderberry Wine” which is my song of the year. The lead songwriter, Karly Hartzman, described in a press release “Elderberry Wine’ is about the potential for sweet things in life (love, family, success) to become poison if not prepared for and attended to correctly” and that “There’s a delicate balance that needs to be created, especially in love, for two lives to intersect without poisoning each other.”, which I just think is such a amazing basis for a song. Hartzman is at her very best lyrically throughout this record, painting such grim yet somewhat silly pictures of small town life. On “Pick Up That Knife”, there is this amazing reference to Afrin addiction, a nasal decongestant spray that can become habit forming if you use it more than a couple of days, which I find somewhat humorous but also a bit anxiety inducing. This band has quickly one of the most consistent and interesting groups in rock and I cannot wait for their next work. Stephen Thompson said on NPR’s All Songs Considered that Wednesday hasn’t made their best album yet. I think he’s right, and that is an exciting prospect.\n\nKey Tracks: Elderberry Wine, Pick Up That Knife, Townies"

The track has these peaceful vocals from Shelley and delightful trilling guitar lines sprinkled throughout. I also just love the concept of a field guide for life; it would honestly come in handy at times! The opening track “Here in the High and Low” is about as big as the album gets, with a grooving drumline and some subtle electric lead guitar. I found myself spinning this record this fall over and over, as it just fit perfectly for chilly days where the sun is setting earlier and we all inevitably move indoors. Tracks like “Everybody” or “New Anthem” have this great swaying quality to them with the subtle pedal steel and hushed tones of the snare brush. The album ends with the super simple “The Hum” with its little infectious hum and minimal acoustic guitar. This album brought me a ton of peace this year and should do the same for you.\n\nKey Tracks: Field Guide to Wild Life, New Anthem, Everybody"

    "text": "3. Guerrila Toss - You’re Weird Now\nI have had a tough time distilling this album down into anything other than “the most”. Aptly named, “You’re Weird Now” finds this amazing balance between raw and fuzzy punk and this digital synth-pop sound that is a bit hard to nail down. But every time you think you have this album figured out, it goes in a different direction. The opening track “Krystal Ball” blows down the doors with a wall of synths, guitars, and symbols before it immediately moves to a alt-rock section that makes you want just jump. “Psychosis is Just a Number” (a track title I still not sure I understand) seems like it can’t make up its mind, alternating between the super hyper chorus or the messy breakdown on the bridges. These wacky and over the top arrangements never slow down, like on the 80s rock track “CEO of Personal & Pain” (my person favorite on the record), which is somehow both groovy and completely in your face. I find the vocal flow on this track in particular is incredible, like on lines like “You know the stubborn never change, the just get really bored of it” (great line too) or “jaded by my own sense of meaningless identity”. “Panglossian Mannequin” borders on a danceable, with a super fun baseline and drumline but not too long before it moves into this stadium rock-esque sound that melts your face. While this isn’t maybe the most important piece of art that was released this year, the fun and craziness is completely undeniable. It might not be for everyone, but I can’t think of a record I had more pure fun listening to this year.\n\nKey Tracks: CEO of Personal & Pleasure, Panglossian Mannequin, Krystal Ball, Psychosis is Just a Number"

    "text": "2. Racing Mount Pleasant - Racing Mount Pleasant\nThis was probably the hardest time I’ve had choosing my album of the year as the top two records are so strong. The self titled record of Racing Mount Pleasant is a tour is of sincerity, delicate vocals, and big sounds led by a massive horn section. It is legitimately hard to put my finger on what genre best describes this group. Are they post-punk? Chamber Folk? Indie Folk? The way they jump between sounds in nothing but astounding. The record opens with the big “Your New Place”, opening with light saxophones and guitars before growing in scale. An unbelievable opener that sets the scene for the record perfectly. “Tenspeed (Shallows)” is my personal favorite, with a horn line that gets stuck in my head so easily. Around the 1 minute mark is this incredibly abrupt symphony of horns and staccato percussion that might be the coolest moment of music of the year for me. The record employs these kinds of tricks throughout, and somehow manages to never get stale. “Seminary” is a dreamy, swaying track that boarders on jazz with it’s horn section that does so much to just relax me. The album really never hits a lull or weak point, with massive tracks like the title track or “Call it Easy” just continuing the big scope seen on the A side of the record. I’m not 100% sure why, but I get this feeling that a record like this is going to have a massive cult following not similar to records like Aeroplane Over the Sea (but don’t quote me on that!). A modern day masterpiece.\n\nKey Tracks: Tenspeed (Shallows), Seminary, Your New Place, Call It Easy"

    "text": "1. Hesse Kassel - La Brea\nMy favorite album of this year goes to a full-length debut from the Chilean band, Hessel Kassel, and what a breathtaking debut “La Brea” is. The record is fully in Spanish, making it the first non-English speaking album to rank in my top 10. Calling this record ambitious is an understatement, with 5 of the 9 tracks coming in at about 10 minutes or more, and run time of 1 hour and 18 minutes. Sonically, this album runs the post-rock/prog-rock gamut, bringing in heavy guitars, busy baselines, and a lot of slowburns. It is hard not to immediately draw comparisons to other post-punk groups; the influence or at least the similarities to the early work of Black Country, New Road are especially clear (hey, the name sound familiar). And yet, this work stands on its own feet and in many ways surpasses the work of its predecessors The lead vocals of Renatto Olivares are real standout; alternating between primal snarls and fragile confessionals that even non-Spanish speakers can connect with immediately. The album starts off strong with the bombastic “Postparto”; the song slowly gaining steam until it reaches the breakdown in the middle of the track with sludgy guitars and an incredibly busy bassline. “Anova”, my undeniable favorite on the record, is this wonderful dance between the vocalist, saxophonist, and pianist, before the band sings in unison, which I can’t help but love. Perhaps the thing I love about this record and Anova specifically is the piano; it is the emotional core of the album and I think is what makes this record so beautiful. “Moussa” is another stunner, containing what is essentially a ambient section, with slowly rising guitars and percussion before the it erupts into a soaring guitar. An unforgettable moment. “Vida En Terranova” opens with a guitar riff that sounds like something Black Midi would be proud of. The song later has what feels like a duel between the arpeggios of the piano and the rolling booms of the drums. The record ends as it started; a big wall of fuzzy guitars before devolving into a pure chaos of feedback. All in all, it is pretty amazing that this is a debut for this group and you can’t help but be excited for what they do next. I can understand that this record is a bit daunting to approach (it took me a while myself!). But with each listen, this record’s grip on my got just a little bit tighter. I also recognize that many of the my top albums of the past few years run on the long side. But I really do hope you give this record the time it deserves. You may find it rewards you.\n\nKey Tracks: Anova, Postparto, Moussa, Vida En Terranova"

I was just having a really difficult time finding music that was resonating with me in the first ~6 months of the year, with a few notable exceptions, which made me a bit nervous about the list. It’s possible that after creating what is probably my favorite list so far the previous year, I was dealing with a bit of a musical hangover. Still, I was finding throughout my typical musical sources/blogs that there was somewhat of a consensus that 2023 was just a weaker year of music. But now that I have made my list, I’m actually incredibly happy with how things came out. The second half of the year was jam packed with fantastic releases that really filled out the list. Additionally, years in which I’m having a more difficult time finding music tend to lead to me branching out a bit more into other genres, which make for more interesting lists (at least in my opinion). For the first time, I have two hip hop records in my top 10, which is a genre I’ve been trying to spend more time it.\nI don’t think it helped that I was on the go a ton this year, traveling back and forth from New York City a lot this year, traveling to Aruba for a vacation that I was incredibly (so incredibly) fortunate to join my girlfriend’s family on, another summer of field work at Whiteface Mountain, and yet another extended trip to Colorado. This year is also setting up the end of my PhD, with my hopes of finishing up in August 2024, and permanently moving to New York. Seems anxieties of producing high quality work, whether it was my PhD or this list was somewhat of a theme this year. I’m very happy with how this list ended up and maybe it’s a sign for things to come."

Interestingly, I find that Julien Baker really stands out on the record, the member I listen to least to. For instance “$20” kicks butt, with scratchy guitars and a powerful vocal delivery from Baker. There are some truly fantastic singles on this record, like the undeniable “Not Strong Enough”, whose chorus is just so amazingly catchy (especially when Bridgers and Baker go into their falsettos). I really like sincerity of “Cool About It”, the theme being friends who are unable to discuss an undisclosed problem/fight.

This is a track that has been on repeat a lot for me since the album dropped in October (and a great soundtrack for my bike rides to work in Colorado). “Think About About It” has a verse that Khruangbin would have been proud of, that I find just so delightful.

There was a lot of great stuff on their previous release Cruel Country, but had too many mediocre tracks due to the attempt at a double album On “Cousin”, they cut out the fluff to make an album that I think of as a sister album to the cult classic A Ghost is Born. While maybe not as experimental as their most acclaimed works, their are great production moments and band adjusts throughout the album. Like on “Infinite Surprise”, the ticking clock adds a certain tension to track, before it finally fading to the background as the rest of the band comes in. On “Evicted”, the track starts off as what seems like simple Jeff Tweedy track acoustic track, but layered guitars start filtering into the track and by the end have the song has changed so much, it makes you wonder how you go there. “A Bowl of Pudding” reminds a little bit of Muzzle of Bees, with its echoing acoustic finger picking and delicate vocals from Jeff Tweedy. “Pittsburgh” is the major highlight on the record for me, as it transitions in and out of a simple acoustic track into a explosion of guitar feedback and synths.

At first, I wasn’t even sure I liked it, but I kept finding myself coming back to it. At times, the record feels like a relic of the past, a soft rock album that probably would have been popular in the 70s. Yet the album also feels out of control and insane, largely due to some undeniable vocal performances from Cameron Winter like on the title track or “See Myself”. The album starts big on the badass “2122”, with Winter’s vocals taking turns with some southern rock guitar riffs. But they pivot sounds all the time on the record. The title track has such a wonderful vocal melody backed by some almost gospel harmonies that give the song so much charm. So many of the songs on the album Geese just absolutely goes for it, like on the energetic Undoer or Mysterious love.

Despite this change, they didn’t lost an ounce of the sincerity that made previous work so special. There is the great optimism to the opening track “Fingers of Steel” despite a more downbeat lyrical content of regretting the circumstances that a person has found themselves in. The vocals from Charlie Steen are perfect; he’s not a classically trained singer by any means, but they rough around the edges approach to his singing are a critical part of what makes Shame, well Shame. Steen is capable of great belting, like the tracks “Alibis”, but is capable of more tender moments like on the best track on the record “Orchid”. I love the lower energy the song start with before it finally ends with an army of guitars and heavy bass to bring the song home. Such a great moment on the record. “Adderal” has this great sing-along quality to the chorus, with the call and response vocals from the Steen and the band. It honestly so sweet sounding, despite being about the inappropriate use of adderall. The album closes stellarly with “All the People”, acting as summary for the whole record.

Despite putting out music since the 90s, this is the first project that I have listened from this group; and it’s a wonderful introduction. There is this great mystique that shrouds over the album that I just find so intriguing. The album strikes a great balance between dream-pop and indie rock aesthetics as the veteran musicians show have shown they honed their craft. I think part of that is down to what I find is excellent production. I love the slight reverb thrown on just about every sound that you hear on the album, but without over-saturating things to the point where you can’t distinguish any of the sounds. I also enjoy that the lead singers alternate each track, keeping the album from sounding stale at any point. I think the album works best consumed all together, but that prevent so fantastic singles like on “Not For Me”. I find the vocal melody so beautiful coupled with the acoustic guitar, subtle background vocal harmonies, and echoing lead guitars. The excellent “Melody Experiment” quickly follows, with these great woozy guitars and subtle noises added into the background, making for a really interesting listening experience. There are some proper B-Side tracks on the album that are bit slower, but greatly add to the character of the album. “I Thought You Should Know” feels like it could be a song in the movie Chariots of Fire. “Via Savona” gently closes the album with much of the same dreamy aesthetics that made this album great. This album grew a lot on me after repeated listens, and I find it is best enjoyed to with a good set of headphones. Give this record a spin, especially late at night.\n\nKey Tracks: Not For Me, Melody Experiment"

    "text": "10. Jolie Holland: Haunted Mountain\nIf there was one word I would use to describe this album, it would be “Magic”. There are just some artists that inexplicably take a relatively sparse sound and just make it so special; artists such as Nick Drake or Angel Olsen who just capture this magic like no other. “Haunted Mountain” is filled with song with the quality. The release of the album was also right in the middle of fall and I can think of few better cold weather companions than this record. I think a big part of the magic of this album comes from the weary vocals from Holland, symbolic of a 2 decades long music career that add a layer of genuineness to each track that is hard to imitate. “2000 Miles” is a perfect opener for the album and a truly beautiful track as it opens with the devastating line “I couldn’t sing a high note, or put on my shoes, without remembering you”. There is such an expert use of space through the album, with the sparest alt-country and americana band arrangements that bring Holland’s words to the front of every song. “Highway 72” features a comfy duet with a musical hero of mine, Buck Meek of Big Thief. There is so much chemistry between the two that you would have thought they have been life long friends. The title track is subtle country ballad that I can easily imagine Jolie Hollarnd playing in some middle of nowhere western bar. “Orange Blossoms” is a dark track, pointing out that that mother nature will be here, whether humans are or not. I really love how Holland closes the record on “What It’s Worth”. The song is a bit dreamier than the rest, with the hushed strumming of rhythm guitar with a single notes being plucked from the lead guitar. After finding this album, I plan to do a deep dive into Jolie Holland’s discography as I haven’t found a singer-songwriter who has resonated with me like this in quite a while.\n\nKey Tracks: 2000 Miles, Haunted Mountain, Highway 72"

    "text": "9. Everything is Alive: Slowdive\nI find it pretty cool that a veteran group like Slowdive can take an extended, 2+ decade long hiatus, and then return making some of the best music of their career. Their previous self titled record, was an incredible dream-pop/shoegaze record that rivals almost everything Beach House have put out, and I’m adamant Sugar for the Pill is one of the best songs of the 2010s. The group returns with the excellent “Everything is Alive”, involving sounds that don’t stray too far away from previous work, but still manages to keep this record distinct. “shanty” opens the album strongly, with the pulsating synth line, distorted guitars, and some a super cool use of harpsichord. “prayer remembered” is a methodical instrumental fill as each instrument takes its turn fading in and out of the track. They pick up the pace with,“alife” is a track reminiscent of “Star Rover” showcasing these great cascading guitars on the chorus; real highlight on the album. Far and away the best track on the album is “kisses’, the lead single, with a lead guitar part that always finds a way to get stuck in your head. This song is absolutely perfect for late night driving. Their are other dreamy shoegaze tracks on the album like”skin in the game” with an amazing tapestry of guitars, especially on the backend of track, or the urgent sounding “the slab”. These guys have been making music like this for a long time now and rather rest on their laurels, continue to put out fantastic dream pop records. Check this record out with (like all of there other work) with a good set of headphones, late at night.\n\nKey Tracks: kisses, skin in the game, alife"

    "text": "8. Andy Shauf: Norm\nAndy Shauf has done it again with another fantastic narrative album, but with quite a bit darker than sweet The Neon Skyline. I must admit, I this album took some time for me to come around. I was more expecting the lush chamber pop arrangements on the incredible The Party or the fun acoustic story telling on the Neon Skyline. But here, Shauf changes his style, with arrangements that are while beautiful, feel just a bit off. However, once I dug into the lyrics further it all clicked. “Norm” follows the story of, well Norm, as his love for a girl turns to an unhealthy obsession. We start the record with the delicately arranged “Wasted on You”, from the perspective of God, worrying that all of the love he shares with humanity is going to waste, before we are introduced to our protagonist, Norm. Norm is day dreaming on “Catch Your Eye” hoping for a chance encounter with the woman he loves. He begins to stalk her, calling her telephone but finding himself unable to speak. God tries to steer Norm clear of these “wicked ways” by speaking to him in his dreams but to no avail. On the eerily beautiful “Sunset”, Norm finally gets his chance, running into his love at a Halloween store, with the two hitting it off, before she comes out to the parking lot to find her car is missing. To her own demise, she accepts the ride, and as she realizes something is up, she uncomfortably asks “are we leaving the city?”, never to be seen again. This track brings the body count in the Shauf’s music catelog to 6 (certainly higher than most artists). The repetition of the phrase “this isn’t the end” only stands to make the song ever creepier. The album closes with a couple of tracks explaining that an ex of the ill-fated woman was a tow-trunk driver and towed her truck the day she was kidnapped, and growing concerned when he doesn’t hear from her. Norm (the record) is another amazing example of Shauf’s knack for unique and impactful storytelling. Like many other artists I love, his songs are often greater than the sum of their parts, including the simplicity in most of the stories he writes. These traits in his songwriting make him unique and it should be no surprise they are a major reason why he is one of my all time favorite songwriters.\n\nKey Tracks: Sunset, Wasted on You, You Didn’t See"

    "text": "7. Billy Woods & Kenny Segal: Maps\nBilly Woods has been on my radar for a little while now as one of the biggest names in underground rap and is just adored in basically every online music community I’m aware. I finally decided to give him a close listen and I’m now asking myself what took so long. Here, Woods teams up again with the producer Kenny Segal following up their previous beloved collaboration Hiding Places to create one of the best hip hop records of the year on “Maps”. There is this amazing sluggishness to the majority beats throughout the album that works so well with Woods cadence and flow. It honestly amazes me how much Woods can change his style with these downtempo beats. The production throughout the record is fantastic. “Soft Landing” is my favorite track on the album, with the jangely guitars and heavy bass. The way Woods nonchalantly asks about drinks before jumping right into the track is such a cool moment. With 17 tracks, this album could have felt like a drag, but with only 5 of the tracks lasting longer than 3 minutes, the record moves on before you have a chance to get bored. “Babylon Bus” is another highlight, starting pretty subdued before building tension with a great feature from ShrapKnel, that finally erupts with strings and horns. This song then transitions sublimely into “Year Zero”, containing a crazy Danny Brown feature (who seemed to be showing up everywhere this…). The lyricism throughout this album is honestly so abstract that just about every track requires thorough listening to fully digest what is being said. Despite the down tempo production found on this record, there are some lighter moments like on tracks like on “Facetime”, with a great hook from Samuel T. Herring, or the jazz flute on “Waiting Around” (with a great feature from Aesop Rock). I feel like I’m going to continue to find things in this album that I didn’t notice before for the months to come. Any hip hop fans should spend time with this record, because there is a ton to digest.\n\nKey Tracks: Soft Landing, Babylon by Bus, Facetime"

    "text": "6. Wednesday: Rat Saw God\nMy introduction to Wednesday is kick-ass, with “Rat Saw God”. The 5 piece indie-rock/garage rock band has produced a collection of 11 songs that are about as vulnerable as you’ll hear from this past year. The first thing that you noticed (and what immediately peaked my interest) is just how loud this record is. They combine all kinds of genres of rock from punk to noise rock to grunge with even some slight country twang with the inclusion of pedal steel (which might be a growing trend in music pointed out by Jonah Krueger at Consequence of Sound, which is a welcome development for me). Beyond the instrumentation is the subject matter, telling stories of drug and alcohol addiction/abuse throughout. A perfect example is on the truly excellent (and one of the best songs of the year) “Bull Believer”, as the first half of the song describes the horrors watching someone you love fall to addiction. The second half invokes of a shitty relationship, watching your boyfriend play Mortal Combat as you sit on a coach on New Years Evve with a nosebleed, before erupting into a huge mess of guitars, as the lead singer Karly Hartzman belts “Finish Him” that collapses into visceral screaming (best vocal performance of the year). “Chosen to Deserve” a Drive-By Truckers inspired track (Hartzman told Apple Music) that tells the story of Hartman’s friends taking Benadryl to get high, as one of the friends take too much and had to get their stomach pumped. I find the framing of this song interesting, using this story as if to say take me as I am, warts and all, and is thankful that she is “the girl you have chosen to deserve”. There are so many times that album just goes for it with guitars like on “Bath Country” or “Quarry”. I really like closing track “TV in the Gas Pump” a great way to close the album as the band steps back from the louder for a more laid back rock sound. I find it a nice way to ease out of what, at times, can feel can be an a pretty intense album. This is a truly phenomenal rock record that demands repeated listening.\n\nKey Tracks: Bull Believer, Chosen to Believe, Bath Country"

    "text": "5. Mitski: The Land is Inhospitable and So Are We\nMitski has always been a slightlt frustrating artist for me. She is so clearly a talented songwriter and performer who has (deservedly) amassed a huge following. But a thing that always bugged me about her songwriting was how short the songs were. Albums like Be the Cowboy have so many great ideas on them, but the songs end before they can leave a real impact. On “The Land is Inhospitable and So Are We”, there is no such issue and the results lead to one of the best indie-folk records of the year. Here, Mitski employs much of the same intimate songwriting on previous project with some alt-country additions (including more pedal steel! Big year for pedal steel). “Bug Like an Angel” starts the album almost playful, with choir singing along with Mitski, but don’t be fooled, as the song has pretty sad lines like “as I got older, I learned I’m a drinker. Sometimes a drink feels like family”. “Heaven” is this great country-style ballad, where Mitski just wants to carve out a piece of heaven with the one she loves. We then transition to my personal favorite track on the record “I Don’t Like My Mind”. I just love the reverbed acoustic guitar strumming on the track, as it backs up a vocal performance that Mitski knocks out of the park. The song is Mitski at her most vulnerable, talking about eating a whole cake before getting sick and throwing up, contributing to a cycle of intrusive thoughts that leads to moments like this. There are a ton of beautiful and tender moments on the record on tracks like “The Deal” or “I’m Your Man”, that has this really gorgeous choir harmonizing (with some slightly disturbing dogs barking in the background). “My Love Mine All Mine” has turned into a mega hit (sitting at 345+million streams as of December, 2023), which a truly magnificent love ballad. The album’s closer “I Love Me After You” , hearkening back just a bit to some of Mitski’s earlier work that was guitar focused like on Your Best American Girl (a damn good song), with almost sludgy black metal chords to close out the album. Is this possibly a hint on the sound of a future album (I hope so)? I tend to not like getting negative in my reviews of albums (an album that makes the top 5 nonetheless) but Mitski extending her songs just by 20-30 seconds is all I really needed to connect with her music. All I can say is I’m looking forward to future her projects.\n\nKey Tracks: I Don’t Like My Mind, I Love Me After You, Heaven"

    "text": "4. Reverand Kristin Michael Hayter - SAVED!\nA quick warning, as I’m going to discuss some pretty dark things including sexual assualt and abuse.\nKristin Hayter has released on the most terrifying listening experiences I’ve heard in my life on “SAVED!”. Hayter had previously released music on the project Lingua Ignota, combining heavy religious themes with dark and distorted soundscapes (a genre known as dark wave). She had developed quite a cult following, but the music is pretty heavy and abstract, and I had always found it a bit inaccesible. Her most recent project, SINNER GET READY, I really began to pay attention more to her music, largely due to her earning an incredibly rare 10/10 from the Needledrop (only the 7th album to do so after what seems like 1000+ reviews). During an interview with Anthony Fantano, Hayter revealed that she had been in an abusive relationship that led to a spinal injury requiring surgery and had to be partially crowd sourced by donations from her fans. SINNER GET READY’s theme was based around this abuse, making for an utterly painful listen. Fast-forward to 2023, Kristin Hayter has retired Ligua Ignota and began releasing music under her own name. SAVED! serves as Hayter healing process, after truly traumatic events, using religion as way to recover. The stylistic choices are quite a bit different than previous records, approaching the album with traditional gospel choir tracks with simple instrumentation, including stand up piano, loose vocal harmonies, and guitar. The production is really where this album stands out, with songs sounding heaviliy distorted and fuzzy, as if you would find the record on cassette in an old, abandoned attic. For instance, on the opening track “I’M GETTTING OUT WHILE I CAN”, the song cuts in and out so aggressively that on the first listen, I had to check to make sure my headphones weren’t broken. Combined with the strong religious themes throughout the album (like bluntly stating all of her friends are going to hell), it makes for a disturbing listen. This album honestly would serve as an amazing horror movie soundtrack about a religious cult. Many of the tracks like “IDUMEA” have these ominous banging piano chords that put a pit in my stomach. Yet, despite all of these uneasy feelings have, these songs contain the theme of being saved by God. As someone who has been nonreligious his entire life, it’s hard for me to understand the complicated relationships people can have with religion, even if it has caused them harm. Religion may have been something has helped Hayter to begin to heal, and if that is the case, it’s a wonderful thing. I think the album closer “HOW CAN I KEEP FROM SINGING” captures my feelings on the album best. The song starts off beautifully, starting with just Hayters beautiful singing and a simple piano accompaniment. As the track goes on, you begin to hear Hayter speaking in tongues, that only get loader and more pained, making for a creepy duet. By the end of the track, you are left with just Hayter sobbing and coughing as her voice gives out. I have yet to really wrap my head around this track, but I currently read as Hayter beginning to find peace but those demons from her trauma remain. I can’t tell you that this is a fun or enjoyable listen. But few pieces of art have left an impression on me quite like this. If you can stomach it, I highly recommend giving this a listen, and then probably never listen to it again.\n\nKey Tracks: HOW CAN I KEEP FROM SINGING, I”M GETTING OUT WHILE I CAN, ALL OF MY FRIENDS ARE GOING TO HELL"

JPEGMAFIA and Danny Brown team up to make the craziest, silliest, bat shit crazy hip hop/glitch hop record of the year. There was a significant period of time this year where I thought a record entitled “SCARING THE HOES” was going to be my album of the year; and it got damn close. The title refers to the unconventional hip hop music that both artists have made in the past that might be considered too weird for a lot of people. They then decide to make a record specifically designed to “scare the hoes”. This album honestly made me laugh more than anything, not because it wasn’t good, but the fact that is was THIS good. The production is just incredible, combining all kinds of sounds and samples that don’t seem like they belong together. “Steppa Pig” changes tempo and tone some many times, with blown out bass and synth lines. I love the difference in how Danny Brown and JPEG approach their verses on this track (and basically every other track) , with Brown acting silly and snotty while JPEG appears to take things more seriously. “Garbage Pale Kids” is my favorite on the record, containing a sample from commercial from the Japanese meat packing company Nichro (of all things) as these great distorted guitars kick in. The detestably entitled “Fentanyl Tester” is an insane remix of Kelis’s Milkshake where JPEG just goes off on the back half of the song. Danny Brown’s line on the track “I’m a big dog like Marmaduke” never fails to make me laugh. I feel like I’m just going down the tracklist and pointing out this that I like on each song, but honestly there isn’t a dud in the bunch. Every song has a creative beat that is crazier than the last. Like the big horns blasts on “Burfict” or on the track “Orange Juice Jones”, which just sounds like Danny Brown’s vocals were accidentally put on top of someone else’s song. “God Loves You” is another favorite of my, starting with a gospel ground before the blown out basses and drum kit join the track, making for a pretty hype song. SCARING THE HOES is the most fun I’ve had with a record this year, with its twists and turns in production, and the always Danny Brown giggles found throughout. I think JPEGMAFIA and Danny Brown accomplished the task the album title i\n\nKey Tracks: Garbage Pale Kids, Steppa Pig, God Loves You, Kingdom Hearts"

    "text": "2. Susanne Sundfør: blómi\nIf SCARING THE HOES isn’t your vibe, can I interest you in some stunningly beautiful singer songwriter music from Susanne Sundfør? Susanne Sundfør is known for making delicate chamber pop and folk tracks (though also has an unexpected synth pop/electronica record, Ten Loves Songs), coupled with her incredibly beautiful voice. On “blómi”, she combines this characteristics with jazz and classical elements to make a truly breathtaking record. The album opens with a spoken word/meditiation piece, combined with some ambient noise. It’s a strange choice but adds intrigue to the record and I personally love it. The record begins in earnest with the dreamy “ashera’s song” with Sundfør’s soaring vocals. We then move to my song of the year, the title track. There are few songs I found myself coming back to more this year than blómi. There is just so much to love on the track, like the optimistic messaging, the great piano chord progressions, or the lovely saxophone solo during the bridge. The vocal melody is just so infectious (especially the repeated line “nobody told you” ) and I always find myself singing along. Just a breathtaking track. “rūnā” is another highlight, with its sweet acoustic guitar strumming that just feel so bright and full of life. “fare thee well” serves as a goodbye track to a friend or loved one, but in line with the rest of the album, there is hope and closure in the track that implies that this goodbye might be a good thing. This is yet another dynamite vocal performance from Sundfør. The album moves into the incredibly fun “leikara ljóð”, starting off as a clapping acapella track with these gorgeous gospel harmonies, especially the on lines like”break the ice and drown me” that almost remind something The Beach Boys would do. The song just continues to build before more instrument joins in to close the track out on a high. There is this kind of silly spoken word track (in German no less), “Ṣānnu Yārru Lī”, layered with ambient noise and jazz flutes, that works perfectly as way to prevent the sound of the album from growing stale. The final full track on the record, “náttsǫngr”, is another stunning piano ballad where Sundfør just nails the vocal part yet again. I feel like a broken record here, but her voice is just such a gift. This album perhaps isn’t the most groundbreaking thing around, but the songwriting and vocal performances are just undeniable. Few works from this past year will bring you more peace than this record.\n\nKey Tracks: blómi, leikara ljóð, fare thee well, náttsǫngr"

    "text": "1. Squid: O Monolith\nSquid are quickly becoming one of the best post-punk bands in the genre, following up their fantastic full length debut Bright Green Field. This album kind of snuck into the number one spot, as it didn’t immediately grab me, but I just kept coming back to it. There are so many different things happening sonically that each track requires repeated listens to fully appreciate each detail. We open with my favorite track on the album “Swing (In A Dream)”, starting with a simple synth line before some crazy chord progressions and guitar lines emerge. This is a key feature of the record, with nontraditional melodies that alternate between post-punk and noise rock, constantly keeping you on your toes. The song builds amazingly to its euphoric end, with these great blown out synths and soaring trumpet harmonies (a great part of their sound they brought back from their previous record). In “Devil’s Den”, they show off their expanded sound, introducting some really pretty jazz clarinet and flute, before swiftly moving into a cacophony of chaotic guitars and some unhinged vocal delivery from Ollie Judge. I have no idea how he does it, but he finds a way to sing at the top of his register without really sounding like he’s singing or screaming. It makes for some really iconic vocal performances that are a key to Squid’s sound. ” Siphon Song” has this bizarre voice production on Judge’s vocals that in most cases would sound kind of stupid, but someone how works perfectly in the track, as the rest of the band slowly builds in the background with a haunting group chant. We then move to “Undergrowth”, a song that is down right groovy, despite it’s minor tonality and another ionic but unhinged Judge vocal performance. I adore the fast strummed guitar parts in the middle of the track; they add this great tension that fits the track perfectly. “The Blades” is another absolute highlight for me. It contains is this amazing urgency right from the get go, with up tempoed drumming and bright guitars. The song just builds and builds in bunch of subtle ways, before the track as just explodes into life, becoming one of my favorite moments in music this year. Another strength of this album is its run time. Over half the songs are longer than 5 minutes with only track coming in under 4 minutes, allowing for each track to take its time developing. And yet, the album run time is only 41 minutes, preventing things from dragging, and making the record more accessible. By the time you get to the brooding “After the Flash” you are well past the halfway mark of the album. Squid bring the record home expertly with the final two tracks. “Green Light” starts out hectic, with crazy guitar lines and vocal performances. But the song relaxes halfway into the track, with legitimately beautiful guitar+clarinet harmonies that really stick out after being in the middle of all of the albums craziness. The final track. “If You Had Seen The Bull’s Swimming Attempts You Would Have Stayed Away” (what a track name by the way) is great way to close the record, employing many of the techniques that have made previous tracks so special. I really like how the rest of the band joins in on the vocals at the end, really highlighting what a team effort this album required to make; it’s a really nice moment. I’ve written a lot about this record, but I still feel like I haven’t done the sound of it justice, with all its beautiful controlled chaos. There is no doubt in my mind that this is my favorite record to come out this year and certainly a favorite of this decade so far. All I can say now is give this album patience, and it will greatly reward you.\n\nKey Tracks: Swing (In A Dream), The Blades, Overgrowth, Green Light"

I spent much of my summer at the summit of Whiteface Mountain, collecting cloud water and aerosol data for my eventual dissertation and was truly horrified by how hazy so many of the days were, despite being 100s-1000s of miles away from the actual fires. During the fall, I had the great pleasure of moving to Boulder, Colorado, for a few months, which was a welcome change from being stranded in my apartment.\nThis list really highlights how much women kicked ass in the music industry in 2021, with 9 out of the top 10 albums and 18 of the top 25 albums were from female artists or female led bands. It was also a list that was considerably cheery than its 2020 counterpart which has to be tied to my improved mood throughout 2021. The only critique of this list I probably would have is a general lack of folk/acoustic/singer songwriter and more experiemental type music. Even so, this album was a perfect companion for a year that represented both healing and tragedy."

It’s hard not to notice how raspy Lindsay’s voice, which add a cool texture throughout the record, but at a cost.

The opening track “Content” is just a perfect way to start the special, with simple drum kit and great little synth lines. The special starts off reasonably bright, with razor sharp commentary, but devolved pretty quickly as Bo’s mental health clearly deteriorates right before your eyes. Frankly, there are times that this special is pretty hard to watch (the scene where he’s trying to film a scene and keeps messing the lines up and freaking out makes my stomach turn every time). “That Funny Feeling” is truly a masterpiece that contains raw emotion that artists not trying to be funny could only dream of.

The real standout on the record however, is Billie’s just truly remarkable vocal performances. Billie has never really been an artist to belt. But on this album, there is just so much confidence and poise that she approaches on every track, like funky “Lost Cause” where she almost whispers at times. “Billie Boss Nova” contains some really great production and rhythm guitar that give the song a lot of personality. Despite all my love for her subtle approach to this record, she gives the album a perfect emotional climax with the iconic title track. I also really enjoyed how Billie spoke back towards the criticisms she was facing throughout the media for things like the double standard of wearing baggy clothes making her not a woman, but losing the layers making her a slut.

The opening track “Leave the Door Open” suit Bruno perfectly, akin to love ballads of his early career like “Just the Way You Are” (which is a banger and you’re wrong if you disagree”). There is just so much fun disco and soul throughout the record, where Anderson and Bruno just play off each other so well. The in studio chemistry is just so clearly obvious. “Smoking Out The Window” is song that gets stuck in my head all the time. I just can’t help but sing along to the harmonies on the line “and I was wronnnggg, and she wass gonnnne”. Just a really cool music moment. The album also doesn’t overstay its welcome, only running at about 36 minutes, as this project could have easily become overbloated. “Blast Off” is great way to close the album, feeling like a great summary for the project as a whole. Oh and how can I forget the Thundercat cameos throughout the record that are just so damn funny. I guess I shouldn’t be surprised that two hit machines were able to make an album full of hits.

There many instances that almost feel like a jam, like on the track “BNR”, the starts off slow and simple before erupting into a percussion heavy psychedelic bop. “Balloons” is so energetic, with this cascading synth line ringing throughout the track, led by almost detached vocal parts.

The record starts off strong with its best song “Hot & Heavy” detailing Lucy helping a love interest find themselves only for the outgrow Lucy, with lines like “You let me in your world until you had enough”. The track also contains a couple of little slow downs that add a something extra to the song. This album is full of emotional gut punches and sad stories that can bring just about anybody to tears, like on the track “Thumbs”, as Lucy accompanies her friend while meeting her estranged father. The line “I love your eyes, and he has them. But you have his”, before imaging popping the fathers eyes right out of his head. Chilling stuff really. “Please Stay” is another heartbreaker, with Lucy begging a presumably suicidal loved one to stay around by any means necessary, whether it be quitting their job, going back to school, or even never talking to Lucy again. “Triple Dog Dare” serves a perfect finale for the record, as Lucy imagines running away with someone. Lucy has always a had great ability to write wonderful lyrics, but this her best effort yet, even if at times is a little bit difficult to get through. As someone who has listened to her since her debut record “No Burden”, its been really amazing to see her develop into the gifted lyricist she is today.\n\nKey Tracks: Hot & Heavy, Please Stay, Triple Dog Dare"

But I kept coming back to it, and it got better with ever listen. I think what kept me around was “Secrets”, which has this unbelievably catchy hook towards the beginning. The album is so much more than just a collection of single though, as song flow perfectly into one another. I really love the transition from “Secrets” in the the video game soundtrack-esque “You Lose”. The arrangements throughout the songs are also complex as they are compelling, with intricate basslines, melodic synths and guitars, and the fun vocals from Mica Tenenbaum. The album just hits you over the head with head bopping track after track without a weak one in the bunch. If I had made my list any later in 2021, this album probably would have climbed even higher in the rankings. It’s also probably the album I come back to the most from 2021.

For example, she opens with the sugar sweet “Pool Hopping”, an energetic power pop anthem with fun lyrics that is a must for any summer playlists. Or on\n“Knead” a garage rock banger that feels like you would hear in a soundtrack to a movie about college in the 2000s. Sarah’s vocal delivery on many of the songs help to keep this loose as well, with her almost sounding bratty at times, which just works perfectly for the tracklist. However, she still shows signs of her more experimental/noise rock side with my favorite track (and I hope I spelled this correctly) “MMMOOOAAAAAYAYA”, finding a perfect mix between crazy chords progressions and face melting power chords (especially towards the back of the record).

A critical component of this band (and most post-punk bands really) is the iconic vocals from Ollie Judge, which at times feel untethered. The album opens strong, with my song of the year “GSK”. It baffles how much ground they are able to cover in just over 3 minutes, starting off reserved before transitioning into noise rock, and then quickly into a little jazz section driven by some tremendous trumpet. “Narrator” is an absolute ride, starting off with a lively and is somewhat reminiscent to the Talking Heads, before descending into chaos, complete with narration (maybe intentional?). “2010” is another example of this band transition back and forth between almost jazz like song structures and then noise rock. This process keeps you on the edge of your seat, as the album could go off at any point. “Global Groove” is such a cool song to me, with out in front percussion and rising horn section supporting the almost scary vocal section. The album closes strongly with “Pamphlets”, serving a perfect summary of the entire album. In a year I was looking for more experimental work, this album was an absolute breath of fresh air.

At this point, I was pretty pumped for this album to come out, and she did not disappoint. She took all of the best parts of her previous work and built on them to make the fantastic “Jubilee”. “Paprika” serves as a perfect opening track, with the best vocal performance from Michelle (which is saying something as this is a record filled with great vocal performances). The album then transitions into the catchiest pop song you’ll ever hear, “Be Sweet”, with jangling guitars, a groovy bass, and the best chorus you can ever have. It’s not a coincidence that this track was my most played song of 2021 according to apple music. To finish off an incredibly album opening, the sweet “Kokomo, IN”, an acoustic ballad with a silky smooth lead guitar (and covered by Jeff Tweedy, which is crazy for Michelle as she may be the only bigger Wilco fan in the world than me). There are just so many amazing pop tracks littered throughout this album, it’s difficult to write about it concisely (including “Savage Good Boy”, “Slide Tackle”, “Posing in”Bondage”).

It’s a such a great feeling to look forward to a new album from an an up and coming artists only for them to fully deliver. I cannot wait for the next thing Michelle releases.\n\nKey Tracks: Be Sweet, Kokomo, IN, Paprika, Savage Good Boy"

    "text": "1. Wolf Alice: Blue Weekend\nIf there is one word I would use to describe 2021’s album of the year, it’s consistent. This album, front to back is just consistently great. Coming off the great success of “Visions of Life”, Wolf Alice returns with “Blue Weekend”, doubling down on the almost stadium-rock influences that made Visions of Life so freaking good. Perhaps the most noticeable thing is the incredible vocals from the lead singer Ellie Rowsell. She just absolutely goes for it in so many different tracks. “Delicious Things” starts things off with a vibe that is prevalent throughout the record, with much of the patented whispered verses before erupting into the heavy guitars and harmony layered chorus that make Wolf Alice so amazing. Another such song, “Lipstick on the Glass” has this great almost marching band beat to the snare drum that I think fits so well with the track. “Smile” showcases the louder, alternative rock side of the group, filled with fuzzy guitars and big vocals. A cool departure from their typical sound is the harmony ladened acoustic ballad “Safe From Heartbreak (if you never fall in love)”, which the line “you fucked with my feelings” is such amazing moment not just on the song, but for the whole record. “Play the Greatest Hits” serves as a fun noise track that breaks things up little to help with the pacing of the album. “Last Man on Earth” is the fantastic piano ballad that builds that I can only imagine must be amazing a live show. Writing about this album has me feeling the same way as when I chose it as my top album for 2021; there are just so many damn good songs on this record. Its not a large departure from the typical sound we’ve come to know from Wolf Alice, but they have absolutely perfected their art. In this writeup, I wrote about half the tracks on the album, which just shows how many of them I truly love. In many ways, it serves as the perfect album for my 2021 list, while maybe not the most experimental or most ambitious, but above all just sounding so good. And honestly, I’m not sure music is supposed to do anything else.\n\nKey Tracks: Delicious Things, Smile, Safe From Heartbreak (if you never fall in love), The Last Man on Earth"

I was settling into grad school at this point and the world events were relatively, well uneventful (excluding whatever nonsense Trump was up to and some potentially concerning news coming out of Wuhan, China). I had also moved apartments within Albany after my old house mates had moved on. Honestly, I can’t say anything particularly interesting happened to me in 2019. Yet, the music was quite fantastic. It was somewhat opposite to the previous year, with not a huge quantity of albums that spoke to me, but the ones I found were absolutely top quality. This remains as one of my favorite lists I’ve made, with each album pick being quite sonically distinct from one another. It’s kind of nice to see that the world doesn’t have to be completely on fire in order for great music to still be made."

There are brighter sounding tracks like “Pressure to Party” and “You Were Right” more reminiscent of her earlier work. “Don’t Know How To Keep Loving You” has this lead guitar part that matches Julia’s vocals that is just great.

But on “WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO”, Billie and her brother create this gloomy bedroom pop that didn’t really sound like anything else I was hearing in popular music at the time. It’s biggest strength is where other pop music tends to ignore; subtlety. She has bangers like “bad guy”, but without the need of big beats or crazy vocal runs. “bury a friend” is an especially cool song. I really enjoy the vocal harmonies that come in and out throughout the song. It makes the song so thrilling.

It’d be wrong not to mention the dark “Boy Will Be Boys” confronting the bizarre permission structure that boys are allowed to have towards girls and women, including things has horrible as sexual abuse.

There are no special tricks here, just honest to god good indie-rock songwriting without needing to hide behind production. There are some many times that Stef starts the song off more reserved before opening into these garage rock anthems and I love it every time. “Method Man” just straight up kicks ass, opening confidently before descending into chaos with crazy drums and tons of feedback on her guitars. “Jumpin’ Jack” is a fun track that opens as almost a rockabilly kind of track before transitioning back to more garage rock.

On Ventura, he moves past that, with a collection of more funk and disco type tracks. The album starts off great with “Come Home”, that starts with this silky smooth drum beat and finishes of with an amazing Andre 3000 feature. Far and away the best track on record is “Winner Circle”, starting off as a jazz rap type track, before Anderson just drops the hammer on his flow on the back of the track (such a cool moment).

His early work has indicated that he is an incredibly talented singer and songwriter, putting out amazing minimalist alternative electronic tracks such as Retrograde or I Need a Forest Fire. And yet, so many other tracks on these records feel meandering and over-complicated, as if he was getting in his own way. This has always made it challenging for me to enjoy his full projects. This changed with the excellent “Assume Form”, with Blake exhibiting some of most beautiful song writing in his career. He has managed to find a perfect balance between experimentation and approachable as his instantly recognizable voice soars on “Power On” or the title track. He recruits so heavy hitter collaborations for several songs including Travis Scott on “Mile High” or ROSALIA on “Barefoot in the Park”. The best feature is hands down the verse from André 3000 that is “little bit heady”; he just absolutely hits verse out of the park on an amazingly melancholy beat from Blake. However, despite some fantastic features on this record, the best track and one of my favorite songs of 2019 is the simple but stunning “Don’t Miss It”. This is Blake at his best, an incredibly simple drum beat bolstered by beautiful piano and haunting vocals, as he describes all the annoyances of life he could avoid if he secluded himself from life, and yet he’d still miss life. I’m just obsessed with the chord progressions in the second half of the song, as the piano swells to the emotional climax of the album. The track is truly a masterpiece and the best thing James Blake has produced so far. This album excited me so much as it is so satisfying watching a talented artist reach their potential and produce a great album. Another year, this album would have comfortably made the top 10, but alas 2019 was a stacked year.\n\nKey Tracks: Don’t Miss It, Where’s the Catch?, Assume Form"

There are so many amazing vocal performances throughout the record, not just from Kiwanuka, but from gospel choirs like on “I’ve Been Dazed” or “Solid Ground”. The major highlight on the album is “Piano Joint (This Kind of Love)”, a song so good that it’s worthy of its own intro track. I just adore the opening piano melody , setting the tone for the rest of track before the string and drums join in on the second half. The song is topped off by the strongest vocal performance from Kiwanauka on the entire record (which is really saying something, as the album is full of fantastic performances). “Hero” is another classic (interestingly also containing an intro track). There some truly fantastic guitar on this song, whether its the ringing melody found throughout, or the fuzzy and distorted solo towards the end of the track. This all capped off by the brilliant echoing of the drum kit, bringing a fullness to the song as whole. The album closer is the beautiful “Light”, combining all of the elements that made this album successful into one track, serving as a perfect finale.

Merling’s vocals are ethereal, as the transcend over ringing pianos, swelling strings, and bright guitars. The album opens with it’s stronger track, “A Lot’s Gonna Change”, a song I must admit I have scream-sung in my car many times. The song slowly builds before it reaches its emotional climax on the line “Cause you got what it takes” that gives me chills every time. The album then transitions wonderfully into the space themed “Andromeda”, filled some truly gorgeous slide guitar. The synth laddened “Movies” has garnered many comparisons to Enya (an artist I honestly know very little about), provides a bit of experimentation for the record, keeping the back half the record fresh. This is honestly a difficult album to write about not because it’s bad, but rather the complete opposite: the album is stunning front to back, with 10 wonderful chamber pop songs.

Tiny Ruins: Olympic Girls\nTiny Ruins, the indie folk project of Hollie Fullbrook, produces these amazingly delicate folk records that immediately put you at peace, particularly the lovely Brightly Painted One; an album full of hushed vocals, intricate finger picked acoustic guitars, and softly ringing electric guitars (an album that has only grown on me over time). More than anything, this bands music captures a sort of magic that few artists are capable of making. I was however first introduced to Tiny Ruins through the lead single of this record “How Much”, one of my favorite songs of 2018. This song serves a case study for the rest of the album; an ever so slightly larger sound compared to Fullbrook’s previous works, but managing not to lose the magic that made the previous works so special. There are a lot of amazing things going on in this song including the Fullbrook’s vocals or the baseline towards the end of the track, but the ringing slide guitar is the icing on the cake. The title track contains some truly fantastic acoustic finger picking before the song erupts into life. “Hologram” has this great woozy guitar on it, a percussion section I’m not used to hearing with this group, and the line “I saw the Grim Reaper, and I gave him the slip”, which is a line I find so delightfully silly. The album closes with the fantastic “Cold Enough to Climb”, serving as perfect bookend to the record. I love the use of space on the second verse where the other piano chords are left by themselves with the very simple drum beat; it really makes the song feel so much more intimate. “Olympic Girls” is a fantastic evolution for Tiny Ruin’s sound, without getting lost in too many ideas with the added instrumentation. Like basically everything else this band puts out, this is an essential rainy day soundtrack.\n\nKey Tracks: How Much, Cold Enough to Climb, Olympic Girls"

Big Thief: Two Hands\nThere is only one band that could make my top 10 list twice in the same year, and that band is Big Thief. “Two Hands” is their second release 2019, serving as the more raw project of the two, with the band opting to largely record live with minimal production, which would prove to be a strength of the record. This decision allowed for the talent of the band to really shine through, particularly Adrianne Lenker and Buck Meek. “Forgotten Eyes”, Lenker’s vocal performance (pretty difficult melody to stay in tune on, I must say) isn’t necessarily perfect, but the slight blemishes adds a realness to the song that just makes it so much more charming. Lenker’s guitar playing is allowed to take center stage, like on the track “Not”, a song harking back to their debut record, contains a 2+ minute, raw and emotional guitar solo. This is truly one of the coolest moments on the record and is something I think a lot Big Thief fans wouldn’t mind them revisiting. Lenker also shows her softer side, with some lovely acoustic playing on the track “Wolf”. But the stripped back production also allows for more Buck’s beautifully subtle guitar playing to shine, like his delicate soloing on the wonderful vibe that is “Replaced”. If this was the only record to be released from this amazing band, I would be truly ecstatic. And yet, being the amazing band they are, they manged to top themselves with an even better release earlier in the year.\n\nKey Tracks: Replaced, The Toy, Not"

    "text": "6. Pup: Morbid Stuff\nPop punk lives! Something I noticed as the decade was coming to an end was that I had very few pop punk rock records that I could look back on. This really bummed me out as I was raised on Green Day, so this genre has always had a special place in my heart. Enter Pup. This was a band that I wasn’t really familiar but my friend Billie was absolutely obsessed with. After the first listen, I was blown away. This was the pop punk record I had spent years searching for. Top to bottom, this album is banger after banger of angsty, emo-ey, power chord loving pop punk. The album kicks off perfectly with the title track, a loud sing along with soaring vocals from the lead singer Stefan Babcock that serves as a perfect example of what is to come. “See You At Your Funeral” is another personal favorite of mine, led by such an infectious chorus. The pettiness behind the song with lines like “I hope somehow, I never see you again. And if I do it’s at your funeral, or better yet. I hope the world explodes, I hope we all die. We can watch the highlights in hell, I hope it’s televised” just make me laugh. Despite no large deviations from their overall sound, the band manages to keep the album feeling fresh. The one major change is on the glorious ” Full Blown Meltdown”, which is practically a speed metal track that just absolutely kicks ass. This record then seamlessly transitions to the fantastic “Bare Hands”, before ending on the quietier “City” to bring the album home. “Morbid Stuff” doesn’t try isn’t the most groundbreaking record; it’s just a collection of pop punk tracks. But those tracks are so good that it’s impossible to ignore this record. As far as I’m concerned, this is the best pop punk record of the 2010s.\n\nKey Tracks: See You at Your Funeral, Morbid Stuff, Full Blown Meltdown"

    "text": "5. Wilco: Ode to Joy\nIt makes me so happy that Wilco is still capable of making music that amazes me. As I have to state with any Wilco album I talk about, my reviews are incredibly biased as they are my favorite band. Anything this band puts out I will probably like. Still, Ode to Joy may be the best effort Wilco has put out since the previous decade (which is likely not a popular opinion among fans). I personally have enjoyed this more somber tone that Wilco has taken on their past couple of records. “Bright Leaves” is a a great example, with the track starting of somewhat dissonant before correcting itself into a truly sweet song. I love the subtle production and noises that are added to this track (and many other tracks on the album) that hearkens back to Wilco’s best work (think Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and A Ghost is Born). “Quiet Amplifier” is a return to Wilco’s most experiemental work and has me immediately thinking of the amazing track Radio Cure. The album does pick up the pace a bit on “Everybody Hides”, a fun song from the Jeff’s side project with his son, Tweedy. The lead single “Love Is Everywhere (Beware)” is Nels Cline, their virtuosoic lead guitarist, is at his very best with an incredibly catchy guitar riff, coupled with Tweedy’s hushed vocals giving the solemn warning of not to be placated by love surrounding you. But the best track on the whole record, and truly one of Tweedy’s best songs, is the closer “Empty Corner”. Is such a simple song, basic drums and acoustic guitar, with light pianos and production in the background. And yet, the song is perfect case study of what Wilco does best; crafting songs where the whole is greater than the sum of it’s parts. Whether it’s the beautiful melody from Tweedy, the perfect use of space for all of the instrumentation, or the use noise in their production decisions to just add the perfect amount of atmosphere and melancholy characteristic of all of the best Wilco songs. The refrain of “You’ve got family out there” is oddly powerful for such a gentle track. I highly recommend listening to the album with headphones to capture all of the layers of the songs properly. What else is there to say other than this band is just so special.\n\nKey Tracks: An Empty Corner, Love Is Everywhere (Beware), Everyone Hides"

    "text": "4. Bon Iver: i,i\nIf you needed any more confirmation that Bon Iver has fully committed to the more electric, almost glitch pop sound, this album is it. Coming off the truly spectacular 22, A Million, Bon Iver takes a slight step back from the experimental sounds to allow for sound containing more joy and optimism. The opening track “iMi” is perfect example, jumping in and out of big sounds and the stripped back vocals of Justin Vernon, before regal horns blast in the second half of the song, a strong start. (Sidenote, these song titles are soooo much easier to type out compared to 22, A Million, something I’m quite thankful for). The record still contains plenty of vocal and digital experimentalism, like on Holyfields and Jelmore, as Vernon oscillates in and out of autotune. The singles from this record are some of its finest work. “Hey Ma” is this super sweet, soaring track whose lyrics still remain a bit unclear to me (though it’s never a bad sentiment to call your Ma every once in a while). “Faith” serves as an emotional peak for the album, where all of the instruments explode on the second verse. The way the instruments and vocal harmonies swell on the track are enough to give anyone chills and is Justin Vernon at his absolute best. My only complaint is I wish the song was a just a little bit longer so we can sit in the beauty just a bit more. “Sh’Diah” is just breathtaking, with Vernon’s vocals at the top of his falsetto as trumpets and saxophones accompany him. This is less of a song and more of an atmosphere and I just think it works so well on this record. “RABi” is a great way to bring the record home, a more straighforward song just a touch of electric guitar and a more streamlined song structure to ease you out of the album. Much like the Wilco record, I highly recommend listening to this record with headphones to capture all of the complex layers of each track. I think this probably Bon Iver’s weakest record, but man if this is as bad as it’s going to get, Justin Vernon is a generational songwriter (which is probably the case anyway).\n\nKey Tracks: Hey, Ma, Faith, Sh’Diah"

    "text": "3. Big Thief: U.F.O.F.\nThe first release of 2019 from this truly wonderful band. This record serves as more of the “celestial” sister to it’s more raw sister album “Two Hands”, containing more focus on production throughout the album. Things start off incredibly strong with the first three tracks. “Contact” perfectly sets the tone for the rest of the album, with Adrianne Lenker’s classic brand of raw and emotional guitar, including a great solo and a truly terrify, visceral scream before the guitar solo starts; a powerful moment. We then wonderfully transition into to fantastic title track, containing a hushed vocal melody coupled with lovely finger picked guitars. The percussion in this track has this interesting little groove to that brings the whole song together. “Cattails” is this incredibly fun folksy bluegrass track that honestly makes me want to stomp my feet. The dual acoustic guitars grow as the song goes on, before you realize how loud and full they sound, making wonder how you got here. Such a strong start to the record. The album is just full of these gentle tracks with delicate acoustic guitar and subtle band arrangements. “Orange” is such a simple song in comparison to the rest, just Lenker singing and a straightforward strumming pattern on her guitar. Yet the track is so powerful and is exactly what the record is calling for in that moment. It then leads into one of the very best Big Thief songs ever made; “Century”. The strummed acoustic guitar sits in the background as the bass, drums, and vocals are brought to the front of the song. The melody grabs you immediately and never let goes. But the real standout in the song is Buck Meek’s guitar playing on the back of the track, a stunning solo that is as beautiful as it is simple. Perfect example of why Meek is one of my favorite guitarists playing today. The reworking of “Terminal Paradise” from Lenker’s solo career is another great moment on the record, with the fast strumming guitar on the chorus, coupled with just stunning harmonies. While not the official last track of the album, “Jenni” serves a perfect song to close out the album (final track is just 1 minutes song with some production). Jenni is like this mellowed out version of grunge or even a bit of sludge metal, with fuzzy guitars that almost drag. Such a cool way to bring things to a close. As I said on the Two Hands review, we were truly blessed to recieve not one, but two truly amazing records from Big Thief. This is one of many reasons I think they are one of the best acts in music right now.\n\nKey Tracks: Century, U.FO.F, Contact, Cattails"

    "text": "2. Alex G: House of Sugar\nIt’s been so much fun watching someone who started by putting demos onto Bandcamp mature so much as a songwriter. Alex G showed some really cool potential with his last project Rocket, combining indie folk, traditional folk, and indie rock with electronic experimentalism. While not everything worked on that project, it had some pretty great moments. On “House of Sugar”, the potential on Rocket is fulfilled. The album opens with the incredible “Walk Away”, that serves a preview of whats to come, exhibiting most if not all of the sounds you can expect from the album, the combinations of folk and electronic experimentation. We then transition into my song of 2019, “Hope”. The song starts almost brightly, with fast strumming on a acoustic guitar before jumping into the soul crushing lines “he was a good friend of mine, he died, why write about it now? Gotta honor him somehow”, talking about what appears to be another friend dying from fentanyl. It’s track that is as beautiful as it is devastating. We then transition into “Southern Sky”, an indie Americana style track (is that even a thing?) with an almost sing-along melody, before the piano and fiddle play a duet to close out the track. “Gretel”, another highlight almost serves as a microcosm of every sound Alex G has used in his career (with pan flute to boot!), whether it’s the grundgey indie rock of his bandcamp days, or the experimental folk found on Rocket. I love how the violin fades in and out as the acoustic guitar strums in the background. These 4 tracks are just such a strong way to start an album. The back half of the record showcases some of the classic experimental sounds that Alex G has used throughout his career, like “Taking”, a track that would have found a good home on an album like Beach Music, with the 90s-esque acoustic guitar combined with the unique production choices. Or on the truly insane “Near” that honestly should be a really annoying song and yet just works for this album. The best track on the back half of the record is “In Your Arms”. It’s hard to explain, but there is a looseness to the track that adds a layer of sincerity that makes this track really special. This album is the culmination of an indie artist really coming into his own sound. There are other years this record likely would have been my album of the year, but 2019 was just such a good year for music, that there is one better.\n\nKey Tracks: Hope, Gretel, Southern Sky, In My Arms"

    "text": "1. Angel Olsen: All Mirrors\nThere is just something amazing about when an artist takes a huge swing at something creatively and just absolutely hits it out of the park. Angel Olsen has done exactly that with “All Mirrors”. Most artists would struggle to top an album that is as quality as MY WOMAN and yet here we are. This project is contains a more orchestral sound, allowing for Olsen’s iconic voice to shine. They could have just settled for this sound and probably made a solid but more boring album. However, this album contains songs that are far more varied and dynamic, giving it so much more depth. “Lark” is the truly extraordinary opener, a slow burn track that slowly builds before unleashing a belting Angel Olsen and a flurry of strings and big drum kit. Such a perfect way to open the album. The title track and lead single wonderfully alternates between synth heavy aesthetics and lush strings. “New Love Cassette” showcases the more subtle side of the record, with incredibly hushed vocals from Olsen and a pulsing synth line. I love the tension added to the song from the staccato strings play halfway through the track; a perfect example of how this album expands on the chamber pop sound. I love the wobbliness on “Spring”; it makes for such neat little stylistic change from the previous tracks. The album contains regal and cinematic moments like on “Impasse” with dramatic strings and Olsen leaving it all on the field with the vocal performance. But this album contains contrasts, with Impasse immediately being followed by “Tonight”. This track is a polar opposite, with a soothing and meloncholy orchestral arrangement coupled with such delicate vocals that Olsen might as well be whispering. Despite these soft vocals, this song is just as impactful as its juxtaposed (pretentious alert) with the louder tracks. “Summer” is this western track, with a galloping snare that you could envision pioneers riding their horses to. “Impasse” is the aptly named penultimate song on the record, serving almost like a jazz standard, with such an incredibly catchy melody. This whole record leads up to the show stopper track and probably Angel Olsen’s best song, “Chance”. It’s hard to put into words how stunning this track is. Olsen had resisted the urge of her belting over a symphony for the entire record and this was finally her moment. The wait makes this song so much more memorable. Her vocal delivery on the second verse is just jaw dropping as she climbs higher and higher up her register. The songs closes with this incredibly present “Its hard to say forever, love. Forever is just so far away. Why don’t you say you’re with me know, with all of your heart.” It is no coincidence that I haven’t written something on just about every track on the album. There isn’t a dud in the bunch and they all contain truly amazing songwriter, instrumentation, and production. The album is truly a triumph and certainly one of the very best of the 2010s.\n\nKey Tracks: Chance, Lark, New Love Cassette, Tonight"

Peter Silberman: Impermanence\nAn aspect of music that I really enjoy when it’s done well is the use of spaciousness, particularly when it emphasizes something within the music like a melody or to highlight a lyric. “Impermanence” takes this to another level. Peter Silberman (famously of the Antlers and creator of one of the most tragic records ever made “Hospice”) recorded this album after recovering from hearing loss in one ear. This hearing loss inspired him to take a minimalistic approach with just faint touches of guitar, syntths, and his angelic voice. “Karuna” is my favorite, as it opens with just the occasional strum of the guitar and Peter’s powerful vocals before building ever so slightly to include more involved guitar work and just a bit of drums. “New York” explores Peter’s noticing and being overwhelmed by noises in New York City that he once took for granted. The album closes as it should, with simple ambient track on “Impermanence”. This is a such unique project that tries to explore the loneliness of deafness with sound (or the lack there of). It may be a bit difficult for some people to get into it due to its spareness, but incredibly rewarding if you spend time with it.\n\nKey Tracks: Karuna, New York, Ahimsa"

    "text": "4. Slowdive: Slowdive\nThe only dream-pop record to rival Beach House, comes from a band that was popular in the 90s before taking a 2+ decade hiatus. This album is just a masterclass it what makes dream pop so amazing, with bright melodic guitars, hushed and reverbed vocals, and an overall melancholy feeling behind it all. The album opens wonderfully with “Slomo” that have the two vocalists intertwining their voices as the ringing guitar envelopes them. “Star Roving” is a perfect track to zip down the highway to at night with the driving percussion and fuzzy guitars. But the absolute highlight is the masterpiece “Sugar For the Pill”. The ringing guitar melody that plays at the start and throughout the track is guaranteed to stick in your head, as the song exhibits cascading guitars before building to the incredibly climax towards the end of the song. The album closes with the beautiful piano ballad on “Falling Ashes”, a nice contrast to the rest of the album. This a perfect soundtrack to any late night driving or staying up late for school or work. It’s amazing that a band can take such a long hiatus only to create arguably their best work. I hope to hear more from them in the future (and maybe in less than two decades).\n\nKey Tracks: Sugar for the Pill, Star Roving, Don’t Know Why"

    "text": "3. Feist: Pleasure\nFeist became a bit of a superstar in the 2000s with her hit album the Reminder and the mega hit “1234”, which is fairness is great music. However, “Pleasure” is far and away her best work. Another album that uses space incredibly well, she somehow finds a balance between delicate and badass, which is an difficult needle to thread. On many occasions, Feist inverts a typical song structure where the quietest parts are reserved for the chorus. Her use of dynamics make the album exciting as it can go from loud to quite to loud again at any moment. On “I Wish I Didn’t Miss You”, the guitar is strummed almost percussively that along with vocal effects, give the track a bit of a bite. There is tons of great guitar work throughout the album like on tracks like “I’m Not Running Away” and the title tracks. Perhaps the coolest moment on the album is the transition of “Any Party” into “A Man is Not His Song”, which then closes with a brief moment of metal in the background. Feist has produced a lot of really great music, but this album takes the cake. An album that I just find criminally underrated.\n\nKey Tracks: I Wish I Didn’t Miss You, Any Party, A Man is Not His Song, Young Up"

    "text": "2. Nick Hakim: Green Twins\nOn his previous two EPs, Nick Hakim managed to make these lovely, sleepy R&B tracks (highlights include “Cold” and “I Don’t Know”). “Green Twins” however, would be a big departure from this and the basis for a lot of his music to come. The record is the experimental, psychedelic R&B and Soul record that is filled with ambitious song writing and truly amazing production. The title track is a great example with a drum kit and fuzzier guitars as Nick’s vocals a drenched in reverb. The guitars come in full force towards the end of the track which just makes the song hit that much harder.”I Bet She Looks Like You” has this great ringing electric guitar part that evolves into a deliberately messy guitar solo that made it one of my favorite songs of the year. “Cuffed” has a great drum beat to it that makes the track feel almost like a jam, and has this really cool slowdown towards the end of track. The B-side of the record, Nick leans more into the production like on tracks “Miss Chew” and “The Want”, filled with layered harmonies and wacky vocal effects. The production on this record is just top notch and it gives so much personality to it, and you’d be hard pressed to find albums that do it better.\n\nKey Tracks: I Bet She Looks Like You, Cuffed, Green Twins, Miss Chew"

    "text": "1. Big Thief: Capacity\nThe album that made me fall in love with Big Thief. This band has become so important in my life and few artists are as consistent of songwriters as Adrianne Lenker (or efficient in their output). “Capacity” came dropped only a year after the incredibly well received debut album “Masterpiece” and solidified them as one of the best acts in indie rock. There is just so much incredibly songwriting and band arrangements throughout the track list, and some of Adiranne’s best lyrical work. “Pretty Things” opens the album with this a mysterious acoustic part exploring complicated feelings in femininity and masculinity during sex. Immediately following is truly wonderful “Shark Smile” that starts off with tumultuously before simply to a driving rhythm guitar part. The song details two young lovers right up until a car crash that kills just one. There is this amazing little guitar solo that Buck Meek does on this track that is so simple and yet is exactly what the song calls for (a playing style the Buck is particularly adept at). “Mythological Beauty” is another stunning song where Adrianne sings about her mother who had her a very young age, detailing her childhood including being rushed to the hospital while her mother held in arms covering her bloodied head with a rag. “Haley” contains a really cool guitar part, showing off Adiranne’s great guitar skills (and a song I have yet to figure out how to play). The emotional climax is on the breathtaking track “Mary”, a piano ballad that is just a true emotional gut punch and the standout for a lot of fans of this album. Big Thief has gone on to put out more truly incredible records, but somehow I always find myself coming back to this one.\n\nKey Tracks: Shark Smile, Mythological Beauty, Mary, Haley"

    "text": "Hello! Thanks for visiting Larry Loves Music. My name is Chris Lawrence but a lot of people in my life call me Larry. For a long time, I’ve been pretty obsessed with music. In highschool I had the opportunity to do a research project of my choosing. For whatever, I chose to research the impact the Beatles had on popular music. For this project, I got to spend my lunch periods reading about the Beatles and listening to all kind of music. This triggered an interest in music that I had never felt before and would change the way I listened to music in the future.\n\nMy First List\nFast forward several years. As I was approaching finals week in my junior year at SUNY-ESF (go Mighty Oaks!), I unsurprisingly was finding myself in the library quite frequently either studying or working on final class projects. I was looking for something to help things bit more bearable. While procrastinating, I stumbled on to two different music related websites. The first was Album of the Year. Album of the year is social network/blog type website not dissimilar to sites like Rate Your Music. However, an important difference that also serves as a database for both reviews from music critics and users of the website. This serves as useful aggregation of what music people are interested in. Since finals take place in early December, it was also “list season”; where major publications release their lists for the top albums of the year. Album of the Year also compiles this information with point totals to provide a consensus album of the year. I found this whole process incredibly fascinating and a lot of fun, particularly when an album you like is seeing a lot of love.\nThe second outlet is from an NPR podcast that I had already been regularly listening to for about year, All Songs Considered. This is a wonderful music podcast hosted by Bob Boilen (the same person who created Tiny Desk Concerts) and Robin Hilton. They had just released a pod discussing listener picks for the best albums of the year. For whatever reason, I found (and still find this…) fascinating. This got me thinking about what my favorite albums of the past year were and inspired me to make my own list. I then wrote down some 30 albums, and listened to each one during finals week and picked my 10 favorites. This was the beginning of a yearly tradition where starting in mid-November, I listen to a large volume of music to make my list.\n\n\nGoing Forward\nThis website has 3 major purpose:\n\nCompile all of my lists and playlists into one place for ease of access\nImprove coding and writing skills with a website/pseudoblog project\nMake it easier to share my favorite music with a potentially larger audience\n\nThis website is a major work in process. I’m still working out many bugs in the website, filling out its contents, and just making things look pretty. I will be constantly be editing things as there will no doubt be typos everywhere. I’m also not particularly adept of this style of writing so this a learning experience for me. I absolutely would love to hear any suggestions from people on what else I should do for this website. I’m thinking about a blog as well but not sure what exactly to blog about. Stay tuned!"

But as far as I’m concerned, Lucy’s biggest strength is her soothing voice, which enhances her words. “Map on the Wall” serves as a nice slow burn track, helping to fill out the rest of the album.

This record is filled with lush strings and subtle beats, topped off with Ry Cuming’s gentle vocals. In particular, “Howling” has this simple little bit and yet does so much to make the song an earworm. “Berlin” remains a super hit for this artist (179 million streams on spotify) and probably the best vocal performance on the record as Ry’s voice matches the guitar note for note in the background. A true highlight is the gorgeous “Beacon” led by the an orchestral string section the builds with guitars and percussion in the background.

The album starts off with this incredible “Intern”, containing nothing but a synth and Angel’s iconic voice, before transitioning into the almost rockabilly “Never Mine”. If this album really demonstrates anything, its Angel’s ability to craft a well paced tracklist, with the front end filled with singles (including the lead single “Shut Up Kiss Me”), with the back end containing more B-side tracks like the dreamy “Those Were the Days”. The track “Sister” remains as one Angel’s best songs, with the front half containing a relaxed ballot that Fleetwood Mac would have been proud of, before building to a soaring guitar solo. This was a statement from Angel, not only in that she has the ability to change up her sound, but that she was going to be one of the most consistent songwriters in music.\n\nKey Tracks: Sister, Never Be Mine, Shut Up Kiss Me"

That being said, this album is criminally underrated in the Wilco catalog. This album only came a year after the well received “Star Wars” (an album title that was meant stir up a lawsuit that never materialized), containing tons of fun songs with fuzzy guitars, loose arrangements, and lackadaisical vocals from Jeff Tweedy. “Schmilco” follows a completely opposite formula, with tight arrangements, a minimalist approached, and some of Jeff’s most introspective lyrics to date. The album opens with “The Normal American Kids”, only featuring an acoustic guitar with lead electric flourishes and Jeff’s voice, exploring his frustration as an and drug use as an adolescent. “If I was Ever a Child” is reminiscent of the alt-country ascetic of “Being There”. “Locator” is an experimentation into a minimalist noise rock song, giving the album some sonic range. I love the very simple guitar/piano melody and almost whispered vocals on “Shrug and Destroy” that just set this wonderful hushed mood. Anything Wilco releases will immediately be compared to there legendary works from the late 1990s into the 2000s, which I think does a disservice to the albums individually. Turns out, even if a record isn’t a band’s best work, if you are as talented as Wilco, its still going to be pretty damn good.\n\nKey Tracks: If I Ever Was A Child, Locator, Shrug and Destroy"

Here, Henson opts for more piano driven tracks, bulstered by orchestral sections. Keaton Henson writes a truly beautiful song that can be difficult to get through. Much of the lyrical content is centered around a particularly painful break up and missing this person. The “Pugilist” starts similar to tracks on “Dear” before growing into the much larger sound that you come to expect from the rest of the album On “Alright” Henson talks about how he’s managing without this person, or lamenting losing this person on the closing track “How Could I Have Known”, that swells into emotional orchestral finale. This album is filled a lot of pain, but for those who can stand it, or those who just want bawl their eyes out, there is a lot of beauty to be found.\n\nKey Tracks: Holy Lover, Alright, I Should Have Known"

The true stand out is the title track “Emotions and Math” with yet another catchy little riff played on the low E string and probably Margaret’s best vocal performance on the entire album.

We first start off with Bon Iver’s “22, A Million”, after 5 years since the breathtakingly beautiful self title record from 2011. That previous record in addition to the EP “Blood Bank” hinted at the experimentation Justin Vernon would eventually lean into. “22, A Million” is nearly unidentifiable from the debut “For Emma, Forever Ago”, drenched in reverb, autotune and dissonance. And yet, despite all these tricks, the album somehow remains authentic and organic, particularly on the rare occasions when just Justin’s unulterd voice appears. It’s a bit difficult to point out individual tracks as this album really doesn’t contain very many fully developed songs. Instead, tracks largely bleed into each other, sometimes making it difficult to tell if there was song changed. Really, this album is truly best enjoyed all in one sitting. A major standout for me is “715 - CRΣΣKS” (man these are a pain to type out) showcasing just the autotuned harmonies of Justin, that use the spaciousness of the song to its advantage. “8 (circle)” is almost sounds like a something high schoolers would slow dance to in 80s and contains this amazing horn section at minute 3 that I adore. The album ends with “00000 Million”, grounding us as it strips back most of the crazy production leaving behind just choir of vocals and a standup piano, and I just find incredibly comforting. Perhaps the greatest strength of this record is Bon Iver finding ways to push the limits of his sound without losing what makes his music great.\n\nKey Tracks: 715 - CRΣΣKS, 8 (circle), 00000 Million"

I don’t mean in the sense of him being sonically adventurous or genre breaking but just huge is albums, with Teens of Denial being his masterpiece. For starters, this album contains not 1 but 2 ~10 minute ballads on the B-side of the record which I think really captures how hard Will was swinging for the fences. A major theme throughout the record is teenage agnst and the drug and alcohol use that often pairs with it. The album opens strong with punchy “Fill in the Blank” a track that could have been written by the Ramones before easy into the albums centerpiece “Vincent”. Vincent is such insane song, starting with just a ringing guitar, building tension and slowly loses control in chaotic climax. Immediately after, the album transitions in the heavy power chords on “Destroyed by Hippie Powers” which just kicks absolute ass. Another highlight is the the anthem against drunk driving “Drunk Drivers/Killer Whales” (though I never figured out what the killer whale is in reference to…). The Ballad of Costa Concorida is the second of the two ballads on the back end of the album that starts slow (with an interesting reference to Didos “White Flag”) before erupting into a grand finale. The ambition on this record is honestly a breath of fresh air and reminder that there is still life within the genre of rock.\n\nKey Tracks: Vincent, Drunk Drivers/Killer Whales, The Ballad of the Costa Concodria"

Andy Shauf is someone I listened to obsessively throughout college (so much so I was seriously considering driving to Toronto from Eastern NY to see him play the day before Thanksgiving), and was because of this album. The album contains incredibly lush arrangements including clarinets and strings, with every instrument (excluding the strings) being played by Shauf himself, allowing Andy to control every detail of the record. “The Party” is a concept album based around events at house party (but not necessarily during the same night). Andy Shauf’s soft voice serves as a perfect narrator to follow different individuals and exploring their thoughts or feelings. Feelings that people are to familiar like being jealous of how out going someone is (Eyes of Them All) or drunkenly embarrassing yourself (Twist Your Ankle). The album also follows two characters, Sherrie and her love interest Jeremy. “Early to the Party” follows Sherry, arriving awkwardly early to a party, with Andy perfectly captures the uncomfortable feelings behind this. On one of my favorite tracks on the album “To You”, Sherry uncomfortably attempts to share her feelings to Jeremy only to for her to back down. The Party even has real drama, with the track “Alexander All Alone”, Alexander collapses dead outside while smoking a cigarette (and oddly enough increases the body count on Andy Shauf records to 4). The album of closes perfectly, with “Martha Sways” as the narrator slows dances with Martha at the end of the party that reminds him of someone else, with lush strings bringing him (and the listener) into a daydream. The song closes with the lines “Martha Spins, and I catch her hand. She smiles and laughs, bringing me back” snapping us out of the daydream. It one of my very favorite music moments. I cannot express how much I love this album and as such, I chose it as my album of the decade for the 2010s.\n\nKey Tracks: The Magician, To You, Martha Sways, Early to the Party"

I graduated from SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry in May 2018, and started my Ph.D in atmospheric sciences at the University of Albany a couple of weeks later. It seems fitting this was the year I decided switch up the format for the album of the list. If there was one year I could pick to redo a list for, it’s probably this one. I decided on choosing 40 albums rather than 10 or 25 as there was just a ton of albums I really liked that year that I wanted to represent in some way. Look back now, I was right; there are just a ton of albums that I enjoy that year. However, 40 was probably a few too many as there are a handful of albums that haven’t aged well for me. I would probably reshuffle the Top 10 pretty significantly as well. Albums like Low’s hauntingly beautiful and experimental “Double Negative” or Beach House’s subperb “7” probably deserve to be higher up on this list, while albums like Lucy Dacus’s “Historian” or the fun hot mess that is Anderson.Paak’s “Oxnard” probably should be lower on the list. Most regrettably, Pinegrove’s “Skylight” is suspiciously missing from this list, which I still cannot believe I didn’t include. Still, 2018 had a lot of music I really loved, and I often associate with graduation. It’s hard not to look back at this list with nostalgia."

This trio includes Amelia Meath of Slyvan Esso, Molly Sarlé, and Alexandra Sauser-Monnig of Daughter of the Swords, all who attended Bennington College together. Together, they produce a master class in minimalistic traditional and indie folk, opting for nothing more than simple acoustic guitar and their amazing vocal harmonies. Tracks like “Whale Song” and “Bright Morning Stars” use space perfectly to really necessitate their siren like vocal harmonies. The incredibly cozy and comforting, “Slow Wake Up Sunday Morning” is true highlight from this record, that is only made better in the context of the full album.\n\nKey Tracks: Slow Wake Up Sunday Morning, Whale Song"

    "text": "9. Father John Misty: God’s Favorite Customer\nThis is the follow-up record by one of the more polarizing figures in indie music; the similarly polarizing “Pure Comedy”. I found “Pure Comedy” to be a very frustrating album, containing some of FJM’s very best song writing, but often overshadowed by preachy and pretentious tracks (such as the exhausting 11 minutes track “Leaving LA”). “God’s Favorite Customer” was a pleasant surprise for me, with FJM returning to the vulnerability and lush instrumentation that made 2015’s “I Love You, Honeybear” so fantastic. This album can almost be viewed a somber sequel to I Love You Honeybear, being based around FJM being temporarily separated from his wife. There are some pretty dark moments on the record such as a literal self plea to not commit suicide on “Please Don’t Die”, or a metal breakdown in a hotel lobby on “Mr. Tillman”. The true standout for me is the piano ballad “The Songwriter” which is about a emotional and sincere I’ve ever heard Josh Tillman sound. The track ends on the soul crushing line “what would it sound like if you were the songwriter, and loving me was your unsung masterpiece”. A true return to form for Father John Misty.\n\nKey Tracks: The Songwriter, Mr. Tillman"

And yet, they change just enough to keep things fresh and interesting, which has allowed them to create one of the most impressive catalogs in music today. On “7” (named for being their 7th album), they are at the height of their powers, creating their best work since “Bloom”. The album opens with crashing drums on “Dark Spring”, a change the largely electronic drum kit percussion on “Depression Cherry”, almost announcing how this album will be different. The transition from Dark Spring into “Pay No Mind” just sounds so cool as the synth drops right in. “Lemon Glow” is hands down one of the best tracks Beach House have ever created, with this ever-present ringing synth alarm, before heavily distorted guitars join the rest of the track. “Drunk in LA” is a really beautiful track, containing a really fantastic vocal performance from Victoria Legrand. Looking back, this album should have been quite a bit higher up this list, as it’s a project I return to a fairly regular basis. Yet another magical dream-pop record from the band that does it the best.\n\nKey Tracks: Lemon Glow, Drunk in LA"

    "text": "7. Jeff Tweedy: Warm\nAs stated in other reviews, Jeff Tweedy is probably my favorite songwriter of all time, so anything he or Wilco release is probably going to be something that I enjoy. On “Warm”, Jeff showcases some of the most vulnerable songwriting he’s since the breathtaking A Ghost is Born. For instance, on the opening track “Bombs Above” regretting mistakes like “I should have done more, to stop the war, so I’m sorry”. “Some Birds” is a Tweedy classic, with an ear wormy chorus and descending guitars that I think is about as good as anything he’s done for Wilco in the past 10 or so years. In particular, I love the line “I break bricks my heart, but only a fool would call it heart”. Perhaps the most earnest Jeff gets on this record is on “I Know What it’s Like”, where he wears his heart on his sleeve with lines like “Even when it’s years away, I still think it’s yesterday, I can’t find the plot, something else is taking shape. I know it’s a line when you say it’s ok”, pointing back to turbulent times in Jeff’s life likely including is drug addiction. While this may not be as inventive as some of his previous works, this album contains a ton of really terrific indie-folk songwriting that really showcases Jeff’s skill as a songwriter.\n\nKey Tracks: Some Birds, I Know What It’s Like"

    "text": "6. Lucy Dacus: Historian\nLucy Dacus’s previous album “No Burden” is a pretty charming indie rock album that contains a ton of potential. Here on “Historian”, Lucy takes a big step in meeting that potential with a considerably bigger sound. Many of these tracks build to these amazing emotional climaxes, with the album being littered with some truly fantastic lead guitar parts. The album starts off really strongly with arguably her break out hit “Night Shift”, the anthemic song about taking a night shift at job just to avoid an ex. All the extra instrumentation don’t get bury Lucy’s just lovely voice, with really great vocal performances on tracks like “The Shell” and “Historians”. My truly favorite song on the album is the slow burn on “Timefighter”, slowly building as Lucy and the lead guitar take turns raising the stakes on the track before the hammer is dropped on the back of the track. That song really kicks ass. The album’s emotional climax is reach on “Pillar of Truth”, a perfect B-side ballad to bring the album home (which contains probably the only time I’m aware of Lucy screaming”. It’s always really cool to an artist you like to try to mature their sound and largely pull it off. On Historian, Lucy Dacus has done just that.\n\nKey Tracks: Timefighter, Night Shift"

This album is just chock-full super jammy tracks with truly tasty baselines and perfectly messy lead vocals. For instance, the album opens with the energetic “Total Football” where the baseline is practically the melody of the track (and ends perfectly with the Andrew Savage screaming “Fuck Tom Brady!”). “Almost Had to Start A Fight/In and Out of Patience” just absolutely kick-ass, starting off as a messy punk song before transitioning into more energetic pop-punk. Immediately following it is the super fun “Freebird II” with another fantastic baseline and great sing along chorus. The album ends with super fun “Tenderness” with jangley guitars and bubbly piano. This album at times can be a tad preachy, but the bright yet gritty arrangements keep this album moving.\n\nKey Tracks: Almost Had to Start A Fight/In and Out of Patience, Total Football, Freebird II"

    "text": "4. Young Fathers: Cocoa Sugar\nYoung Fathers create such unique sound, fusing hip-hop, synth-pop, gospel, and electronica. Even more impressively, they manage to capture such joy and optimism throughout this record. “In My View” is perfect example (and the best track on the album), that has just this amazing sing-along chorus. The vocals towards the end starting off with “Lay my belly on a women, leave a damsel for Delilah” gives me goosebumps . Or on “Holy Ghost”, another super catchy hook combined with a hypnotic flow on the verses. “Border Girl” is truly a wonder, containing such warm chorus with gospel choir backing vocals surrounding it. I truly love the vulnerability in the lead vocals towards the end of the song when things have reached their emotional climax. A thing about this record that really sticks out to me is the minimal use of snare drums (either digitally of from a drum set) in many of the tracks. At first it can make the songs feel a bit hollow, but on further listens, other components (particularly the bright melodies) of the tracks reveal themselves and more than make up for its absence. This, combined with the just top notch production, creates a truly a unique album that is a bit difficult to define easily. This is just a really freaking cool record and no artist sounds quite like Young Fathers.\n\nKey Tracks: In My View, Holy Ghost, Border Girls"

    "text": "3. Bill Ryder-Jones: Yawn\nFew know how to make a somber record quite like Bill Ryder-Jones. I first fell in love with Bill’s music with his record West Kirby County Primary, a wonderful album consisting of melancholy indie-rock tracks (Satellites is a true highlight with it’s sludgy guitar coming in the beginning and end). On “Yawn”, Bill Ryder-Jones keeps a similar aesthetic but fills out the guitar section and brings in a cello. The result is a beautiful tapestry of sound, with the rhythm guitars, cello, and Bill’s soft-spoken voice laying a foundation for the bright lead guitar to drive the melody. The album opens with “There’s Something on Your Mind”, showcasing a very similar sound to West Kirby County Primary, before arriving to the sound of the rest of the of the album. “And Then There’s You” is probably the brightest the album gets, containing a pretty badass guitar lick. “Don’t Be Scared, I Love You” is unexpected earworm, bolstered by the low hum of the cello and plucked strings played at the top of the neck of an electric guitar. But the true standout is the masterpiece that is “Mither” (a word I had look up meaning to make an unnecessary fuss, moan, bother). To this day, I’m still in love with track as it’s just so easy to get lost in. A slow-burn kind of song, with Bill opening with “Will you still play on mind?” . But the song evolves on the second part, bursting into a sea of fuzzy guitars, with the lead guitar popping in and out of the song. This album is a perfect kind of winter or late-night record, when you’re feeling a little bit down. Truly a breathtaking effort from Bill.\n\nKey Tracks: Mither, Don’t Be Scared, I Love You, And Then There’s You, There’s Something on Your Mind"

    "text": "2. Car Seat Headrest: Twin Fantasy\nI debated about including this album on the list. On the one hand, this album is a re-recording of the 2011 version so does it really count as a 2018 album? On the other hand, many of the arrangements sound very different (the album sounds like it was recorded on a potato) and I was only familiar with the 2018 version. Then I realized that this is my list, and this album rules, so I can include it if I want. As mentioned, Will Toledo released the 2011 version to Bandcamp when he was only 17 years old, which looking at the scope of the album is a truly remarkable thing. This re-recording is welcomed as while the original version contains a lot of charm, the production value makes it a difficult listen (unless you really love your lo-fi). There is so much ambitious and power to so many of these tracks. Take the opening track. “My Boy - Twin Fantasy”, a simple but effective introduction just inundated with power chords and belting vocals. Then there is the true masterpiece (and my top song of 2018) that is “Beach Life-In-Death”, a sprawling 12+ minute track split into three sections. There are a lot of great lyrics in this song but the line “they should call it anti-depression, as a friend of mine suggested. Cause it’s not the sadness that hurts you, it’s the brains reaction against it” is one that has stayed with me. The front half of the album is truly stacked, with album quickly transitioning to 4 amazing singles started off by “Sober to Death”, a great indie rock track that ends with these really cool triplets with the refrain “Don’t worry, you and me will never be alone”. “Bodys” super danaceble track which is amazing to see live. “Cute Thing” is just an absolute banger, with guitars on the back that just rip so hard. I particularly enjoy how this album closes: A 16 minutes oddessy on “Famous Prophets” (another track that rips pretty hard, and great conclusion on ’Twin Fantasy (Those Boys)“. It’s staggering to see that a 17 year old had the ability to craft such a powerful album. This (along with other work) solidified Will Toledo as a Bandcamp hero, gaining a pretty strong cult following throughout the 2010s that only grew rapidly after the release of the classic”Teens of Style“. Safe to say, Car Seat Headrest is a favorite of mine, and I get the feeling this project has another classic under its sleeve.\n\nKey Tracks: Beach Life-in-Death, Cute Thing, Bodys, Sober to Death"

    "text": "1. Courtney Barnett: Tell Me How You Really Feel\nThere was no album in 2018 that I was anticipating more than the follow up to Courtney Barnett’s incredible debut “Sometime I Sit and Think, and Somtimes I just Sit”, and “Tell Me How You Really Feel” was everything I needed it to be. Compared to the more observational approach on her previous effort, Courtney takes a slightly more serious tone, tackling issues from mental health to sexual assault. The most impressive thing to this record is just how consistent it is. There isn’t a dud or mediocre track in the bunch. The album opens strongly with “Hopelessness”, a reserved track with some Courtney’s most introspective lyrical work like “Your vulnerability, stronger than it seems. You know it’s ok to have a bad day”, before erupting into a fuzzy guitar haze. Things transition quickly to my personal favorite on the album “City Looks Pretty”, as Courtney points out benefits of anonymity in a city when your mental health isn’t at its best, with lines like “Friends treat you like a stranger and strangers treat you like their best friend oh well”. The song excellently with a tempo change into a simple but bright blues riff. Mental health is a clear theme explored throughout the album, like on “Need A Little Time” with lines like “shave your head to see how it feels. Emotionally its not that different, but to the hand it’s beautiful”. This is a line that I still have a hard time interpreting beyond a haircut can provide someone small sense of control and that is comfortable. The album at this point really picks up the pace, with the iconic lead single “Nameless, Faceless”. Courtney laments the general lack of safety that can be associated with being a woman, whether it’s wanting to walk alone in the park at night without need to have your keys between someone’s fingers, or dealing with targeted online harassment (sidenote, this song has such a funny line with”I could a bowl of alphabet soup and spit better words than you”). At this point, the album devolves a bit, with anger clearly being released on the kick ass “I’m Not Your Mother, I’m Not Your Bitch”. Still, even in the anger, Courtney manages to keep her sense of humor with lines like “I’m not your mother, I’m not your bitch. Di..Did I stutter? A little bit”. Recognizing some of the heavier material on this album, Courtney closes the album with the delightful “Sunday Roast”, a welcoming song describing a brief escape from the world with a simple dinner with a friend. The final track leaves the listener with a small sense of optimism, that even in a dark and frustrating world, simple moments like dinner with a friend can be life affirming. 2018 was tremendous year for indie-rock, (evidenced by 4 ending up in the top 10), so it should be no surpise that an indie-rock album topped the list. For this year, Tell Me How You Really Feel is the best of the best.\n\nKey Tracks: City Looks Pretty, Nameless Faceless, Need a Little Time, Hopefulessness"

    "text": "This was a bad year. I’ll never forget my roommate at the time, Mike, asking me in January if we should start stockpiling supplies as things in China were looking kind of scary. I laughed and dismissed it all as media hysteria. Early in March, 2020 I had packed up my car and embarked for Boulder, Colorado for a 2 month internship with my buddy Matt. We had been hearing stuff on the news about COVID, but didn’t think things would get too bad. When I arrive at work, i find out that if I had shown up a day later, they weren’t going to let me in the building. A few days later, we get the “go home for 2 weeks” instruction. Another week later I packed my car back to go home, and not leave really leave home for a long time. To make things worse, the presidential election became an utter shit show, with election “night” stretching into election week in which I slept very little. It wasn’t all bad news. I managed to pass my written exam, a major milestone in my journey to receiving my PhD.\nWith all this in the background, this made for an odd year of music for me. I find that this list is a more melancholy or experimental than other years, which probably matches how I felt at the time. Still, despite all of the awfulness that came out of this year, I did manage to find some truly great music."

Still, this album has moments of bigger sound like on the delightful “Wonder”, or a “Reach”, which sounds like it belongs on Weezer’s “Blue Album”, right after Undone.

The halloween-esq “I Want You To Suffer” begins with this almost Scooby Doo vibe to it before descending into pure distortion and feed back that is honestly quite unsettling, before coming back into focus. The following track has this 1940s song quality to it, but feels like it’s being played on a broker radio playing in another room. The album closes on it’s best track, “Heavy Metal”, sharing a similar oldies song style to it, but has this infectious guitar riff, a swelling string section, and a sweet choir of vocals, ending an album that at times can be quite abrasive, on a beautiful note."

My favorite song on the record “Gods Dirty Work” has this amazing contrast between a strummed acoustic and a silky smooth lead guitar that just play off each other in way that I’m just in love with.

In short, things were scary and tense. The world needed (or at least I believe the world needed) this record. “Shore” feels like a sister album to the fantastic (and slightly underrated if you ask me) “Crack Up”. However, rather than the grandiose songwriting that can make the approaching the project a bit daunting, on “Shore” the Fleet Foxes simplified things to allow songs to work better on their own, and to wonderful effect. This is just this bright optimism on songs like “Sunblind” that filled me with comfort. “Featherweight” is a standout track on the record, open with plucky acoustic guitar and an almost sea-faring vibe to it. As all Fleet Foxes albums, their are layered harmonies, folk acoustics that border on medieval aesthetics , and the undeniably melodic lead vocals from Robin Pecknold.

Sarah Tudzin of illuminati hotties released a really fun power pop/indie rock record in 2018, so I was interested to find out that this project was releasing a new album. However, this is no typical follow record, really considered more of a mixtape. At its core, this album is a punk album, filled with great production and biting lyrics. “Freed Ppls” is this almost speed metal like track that hits hard and collapses into chaos. “Content//Bedtime” is the describes the all too real feeling of a having a day being filled with just work then bed (probably a little to well…). Another striking thing about this record is it’s brevity, coming in at a very quick 23 minutes with only 1 song lasting longer than 2 and half minutes. Despite much of the album being recorded before the pandemic, the lyrics on “Free Dumb” reading “there was no love lost until you demand that I was non-essential” hits much harder in the context of 2020. And yet, it feels as if you get a full album experience. The closing track is a nice way to close out feelings of anger and anxiety, with Sarah thinking of things about loved ones that make her happy. This mixtape may not be the one we were supposed to wait for, but it’s hard to deny that something truly special was made here.\n\nKey Tracks: Free Ppls, Content/Bedtime, Melatonezone, Superiority Complex (Big Noise)"

    "text": "2. Andy Shauf: The Neon Skyline\nAbove all, Andy Shauf is a story teller. On his truly extraordinary “The Party”, Andy had already demonstrated his ability to craft a concept album. Here on the “Neon Skyline” Andy steps back the lush arrangements just a bit to allow for the story to take center stage, following a guy hearing about his ex-girlfriend returning to his hometown, only to run into her at while out at the bar, and unsuccessfully trying to make his move. This album is only about 34 minutes, and yet there is so much characterization throughout, whether it’s talking about reincarnation on “Dust Kids” or on the lounge-room like “Living Room” where a mother laments her acting like her father toward her own kid. Andy Shauf’s voice serves as a perfect narrator, providing a pleasant tone that doesn’t distract the story telling throughout the song. I’m just not aware of other artists that can capture the intimacy of relate able situations quite like Andy. The album closes perfectly with “Changer”, where the protagonist and his ex are just catching up talking about how the met and what brought them back to town, enveloped with a sweet but simple guitar part and Andy’s distinct clarinets. You truly feel like you have lived through this experience, and all in just 34 minutes.\n\nKey Tracks: Living Room, Changer, Try Again, The Neon Skyline"

I also am not sure this would be my album of the year if it was released on a different. But context matters so much when making these lists, and it was an obvious choice for the top spot in 2020. This just struck a perfect emotional chord with me. There is also just a truly amazing number of amazing songs. “Kyoto” is this fun ( well at least sonically) song with a memorable trumpet part to the track and chorus that’s just begging you to scream-sing along. “Saviors Complex” has this incredible melody that I can’t help but hum along with every time it comes on. “ICU” has the slow burn to it that builds to the amazing final chorus and has the great lyric ’I hate your mom, I hate when she opens her mouth. It’s amazing to me how much you can say when you don’t know what your talking about” The albums ends with the truly cathartic finale on “I Know the End”, ending with Phoebe just screaming, which was just such a relateable feeling at the time. The album inevitably launched Phoebe into stardom, and it’s just such a cool thing to see, as this is an artist I had heard of since college, before her full-length debut. All in all, this album may not be all time favorite number 1 album of a year, but it’s one of the most important number 1 albums on all of the lists I’ve made.\n\nKey Tracks: Kyoto, ICU, Garden Song, Savior Complex"

I began the year by successfully passing my oral exam, which is the final step before I defend my dissertation and (hopefully) receive my PhD (hoping to be done in 2024, which isn’t far away….). I also met my lovely girlfriend Karen, who has been a wonderful addition to my life. World events have been somewhat positive as well. The war in Ukraine has been going considerably better than anyone (besides Ukraine) could have imagined. COVID is starting to become a more mild and losing it’s ability to collapse the health care system. Perhaps the biggest develop in my field was the passage of the inflation reduction act, which is mostly a giant climate bill throw $350+ billion dollars in various ways at tackling greenhouse gas emissions in various ways, which has given me more hope that U.S. is actually going to do something about climate change.\nOn top of all of the relatively positive news this year, 2022 was a truly incredible year of music. I have never had so much trouble deciding on my list this year, with 11 albums that probably would have made the top 25 albums any other year that didn’t make this year. Artists I had to leave off have made other lists in the past including Wilco, Nick Hakim, Andrew Bird and Alt-J. The top 10 is arguably the strongest I’ve made, with the top 4 positions only being decided a week or so before posted my list. Lastly, my favorite album from this year is the front runner for album of the decade and one I come back to constantly. All in all, it’s been a pretty good year for me."

This album contains a whopping 109! tracks and a run time of 3.5 hours. It’s a collection of spoken word, ambient music, industrial music, and occasionally singer songwriter and folk compositions. This album is pure chaos, with little structure track to track. In fact, the tracklist is in alphabetical order, implying that the artist is fine with people putting the album on shuffle. I highly recommend doing this as it gives you a unique listening experience each time. I’m still trying to fully wrap my head around this album, but I’ve fallen in love with it and will be on the look out for albums like in for next year. The reason I put this as an honorable mention, as it really doesn’t feel like an album that I can compare to others, but I wanted to point it out at the same time. It’s a pretty daugting task, approaching a 3.5 hour album, so some tracks to try first probably would include “Carefully”, “Battling Dust” and “Badman”. I suspect most people won’t be into this, but I still hope you’ll give it a try, as it’s the craziest thing album I’ve added to a end of year list.\n\nKey Tracks: Carefully, Battling Dust, Hide, Office, Badman, and many more"

The album opens with the best track “Habitat” starting with loud guitars, before the song deconstructs into the beautiful acoustic section complete with nature sounds in the background, before transitioning in the urgent “Alaska”. “Orange”, a song the placed very high on my top songs of 2021, returns for 11:11 and remains as necessary as ever. My only minor gripe with this album is how little of the rest of the very talented band we get to see on this record.

Like other pop artists I’m loving in this day in age, there is a subtlety to the way he approaches his songs both in writing and vocal performances. “Grapejuice” has this great ringing guitar note throughout the track combined with banging piano chords that pair perfectly with his revered vocals that create a relaxed vibe. “Keep Driving” has this great dreamy aesthetic to it that makes you want to get lost on a road trip with someone you love. Finally, Matilida has this amazing acoustic guitar part that to this day still eludes me, despite my best efforts to learn it.

But, they keep the thing they makes them a special band; the ability to craft anthems (classics like Archie, Marry Me and In Undertow). “Easy on Your Own” is a perfect example of this, as it builds to big emotional climax that I imagine would be amazing to see live. Most of the album contains songs with pretty quick tempos, which makes feel like its in a rush and ends before know it. This make it easy to listen to over and over. “Belinda Says” is my personal favorite; another anthem that has such incredible key change towards the back of the song.

This album is just filled with psychedelic rock and r&b tracks that bleed into each other wondefully. The album starts off boldly, with a guitar features from the super talented Unknown Mortal Orchestra on “The Medium” before going into the saxophone ladened “Goes By So Fast”. “The Loop” is a song I dare anyone not to bop their head to, as laments getting stuck in a boring routine that is making time pass too fast.

The album opens with “Bones”, which is not wildly distinct from her previous work before it transitions into the grunge heavy”With U”, with thick distorted guitars and muted verses. The lead single “Shotgun” is probably the best track on the record, finding the perfect balance between her ear-wormy songwriting style and this new found grudge style. She closes with “Still”, another track reminiscent of her older work that just feels so fitting to end the album with.

There is this ominous feeling that surrounds the album, driven by the melancholy piano and hushed vocals from Koen van de Wardt. Still, there are bright spots on the record, like “Plastic Gun”, which has synth and bass lines that goes pretty hard, or the ringing chorus on “Disguiser”. I love how the album closes, with “Syliva”, a slow burn track with a sing-along chorus that serves a perfect conclusion for the indie-pop adventure this album takes you on.

Compared to their instant classic “Morbid Stuff”, which contained straight ahead pop-punk and emo-rock sounds, PUPTHEBAND goes for a nosier, less polished sound, particularly towards the back of the album. As the album evolves, the tracks become less melodic and become more chaotic, more than likely symbolizing the bands inevitable unraveling. I find the piano skits/interludes endlessly entertaining, as the band is running out of money trying to finish a record and fighting. “Totally Fine” is such a great way to start the record, starting off chaotic before settling back into the farmilar melodic choruses of their previous work. “Matilda” is another highlight of the record, containing the perfect chorus to scream-sing to (and which I did in person in the at a show in the summer of 2022). As someone who grew up on Green Day, pop-punk is always going to have a special place in my heart.

His previous record “House of Sugar” is indie-folk gem and was my second favorite record of 2019 (a pretty stacked year). On “God Save The Animals”, I still haven’t figured out exactly why I love this album so much. On paper, much of it seems like simple indie folk songs you’ve heard a lot times. But I don’t know, there is just something special going on in the background. “Runner” has the infectious melody to it, with a piano bringing the song to life. I also love how he says “they hit you with a rolled up magazine”. Even with the deceiving songwriting approach to this record, Alex finds ways to bring back his famous experimental songs that just about every album has like on “S.D.O.S” and “Blessing”. “Miracles” is another beautiful track that just brings me so much comfort, with Alex’s fragile vocal performance and the fiddle in the background. My best guess to what makes this album click with me is that Alex G, despite all of production tricks he brings to music, there is core sincerity to everything he does and God save the Animals has boatloads of it. This yet another special addition to Alex’s stellar catalog.\n\nKey Tracks: Runner, Miracles"

It’s such a fresh sound, combing screamo and punk with trap rap, giving this incredible speed and volume not only in the instrumentation but from the flow of GG Guerra. The album starts with a bong rip to the 20th Century Fox drum roll before the guitars start in on “Gold Chain Punk”. The song starts off fairly bright before getting more and more chaotic and by the end you can’t ever recognize where you came from. There is tons of anxiety in the lyrics (if you can keep up) that make the song so much more real. The band is also incredibly talented, constantly changing tempo and the approches to their sound, which keeps the album feeling fresh. “Jump!! (Or Get Jumped!!!)(by the future)” is an absolute whirlwind of a track that changes tempo so many times you get whiplash. “Driponomics” is such a mood change for the record, moving to truly insane beat instead where GG gets to really show off his flow (and super cool feature from Mother Maryrose). I’ll also love any song that comes after Reganomics. This album is so unique in its approach and just hits so go damn hard.

On “Expert in A Dying Field”, they have truly outdone themselves here with the catchiest tracklist yet. Everything about this album is just so charming and infectious, whether is the sweet vocals from Elizabeth Stokes or the clear chemistry this band has with one another. The title track is such a well crafted song, starting off fairly reserved, before building to the end with their classic call and response harmonies between Elizabeth and the whole band. This call and response is utilized throughout the album and I love it every single time because it just adds so much personality. “Silence is Golden” is neat little musical experiment for the group with rapid lyrics from Elizabeth and drum beat that I can only imagine is really difficult to keep on tempo. “Head in The Clouds” is another fantastic track that has the band almost serve as doo wop group with their back up vocals. It’s amazing to me that after all of the indie-rock music that has been released in the past 20 years or so, there is still life in the genre.

Here on “And in The Darkness, Hearts Aglow”, the second album of a triology, she takes a step back from some (but no all) of the production, making the songs feel a bit more organic. “It’s Not Just Me, It’s Everybody” is content to swim it’s own aesthetic, letting Natalie Mering’s voice carry you through the song. A real highlight is”Children of the Empire” , an expansive track with strings, drums, bells, harmonies, and some pretty great snapping. But the real show stopper for me is “God Turn Me Into A Flower”, a patient track containing just synth lines and a truly incredible vocal performance from Natalie. The outro to the track has this great ambient section that works nature songs into that is really stunning. “A Given Thing” is a perfect way to close the record, a piano ballad to close proceedings with another stunning vocal performance from Natalie. This album doesn’t have the same studio tricks as her previous album, but I feel like this album does a better job showcasing what a truly incredible singer Natalie Mering is.

    "text": "8. Jockstrap: I Love You Jennifer B\nIn September, I was looking one more kinda experimental record to add to my top 10 list. Enter the duo of Georgia Ellery (also a member of Black Country, New Road crazily enough) and Taylor Skye, under the name “Jockstrap”. “I Love You Jennifer B” is this incredibly collection of glitch pop and electronic songs that keep you guessing throughout the record. The album opens pretty unassuming with “Neon” before it explodes in a rush of guitars and keyboards out of nowhere. There is so much cool production on the vocal performances from Georgia, like on “Angst”, speeding up the track, which feels almost unsettling. “The Greatest Hits” is a real highlight for, with a such a catchy beat and keyboard part that I always bop my head along to. But my personal favorite is on “What’s it All About”, this dreamy track with strummed acoustic guitar and string flourishes that make for a really beautiful song. There so many other tracks with crazy production that I really don’t have time to get into detail with like “Concrete Over Water” or “Glasgow”. Please spend time with this album, you’ve never heard anything quite like it.\n\nKey Tracks: What’s It All About, Greatest Hits, Concrete Over Water"

    "text": "7. Florist: Florist\nI first discovered Florist with their 2017 record “If Blue Could Be Happiness” and fell in love with the title track. They just create these spacious songs that are so peaceful that sound like something that could come out of Adventure Time (particularly the end credits song). On their self titled record, they build on this by creating a minimulaistic indie-folk record that borders on ambient at times. Throughout, there are these great little production parts that add so much to such bare bone songs. The lead vocals are perfect for this album, matching the peaceful songwriting approach. This is a pretty long album, with 19 tracks coming in a just short of 1 hour makes it difficult to handpick tracks, but “Sci-Fi Silence” and “Two Way”s are tracks that really stand out to me. I really enjoy the ambient tracks throughout the record that include bells, rain, and subtle guitars (like on “Duet for Guitar and Rain”). They also serve to help prevent the record for dragging on or overstaying its welcome. This album even has a minimalistic jam on the track “43”, which has the great guitar solo towards the end of it. This album is such a perfect way to declutter my brain, particularly on stressful days at work or as I’m falling asleep. Florist have really outdone themselves with this work.\n\nKey Tracks: 43, Two Ways, Sci-Fi Silence."

    "text": "6. Beach House: Once Twice Melody\nNormally, I’m not a particularly big fan of double albums, as in attempt to fill out the tracklist, artists sometime include weaker songs that could have been removed for a tighter single album. But it seems 2022 was a major exception to that rule, and I can’t be surprised that the dream pop masters were the ones to do it. The release of this album may have help in part with it, as they released it 4-5 songs at a time, which helped the audience digest the individual tracks more easily. What can I say, its another Beach House triumph. The self title track is a perfect way to open the album, with plucky acoustic guitars, lush strings, and Victoria’s ethreal vocals. “Pink Funeral” is one of my favorite tracks they’ve ever release, sounding a bit more sinister compared to their other work. This album contains so many songs that will likely become classic Beach House tracks, like “New Romance”, this big sounding track that feels so optimistic, especially as the chorus kicks in with the drum kit. “The Bells” has this fantastic ringing guitar to that I’m obsessed with. This album can feel a little bit daunting going into it, so approaching it the same way Beach House released the tracks is honestly a great way to become familiar with. Large tracklists can sometimes cause people to ignore certain songs. But on this record, just about every song requires your attention. Beach House remains the king and queen of dream pop.\n\nKey Tracks: Pink Funeral, New Romance, Once Twice Melody"

    "text": "5. Angel Olsen: Big Time\nIt’s becoming kind of absurd how much incredible music Angel Olsen has released, and Big Time is yet another incredible addition. The origins of the album are unfortunately tragic, as Angel had just came out gay to her parents and was greeted by love and acceptance, only for her to lose both of them suddenly a couple of weeks later. Really changes of the context of many of the songs. Angel had humorously billed this album as “not country, but it’s also not not country” which I think a perfect description. Tracks like “This is How It Works” and the title track, you can clearly hear country influences, particularly with the very prominent and well done pedal steel. Angel is still capable of creating a huge ballad with the opening track (and best track) “All the Good Times”. The line “the way that she said, as heavy as led, you know how to get straight to my head” gives me chills on every listen. “Ghost On” is another great ballad that flows so beautifully before the great guitar solo comes in towards the end of the album. As with any Angel Olsen record, her iconic vocals shine through on just about every track, which elevates already great songwriting to another level. The final track “Chasing the Sun” is an emotional ending to the album as Angel surrenders to the love she has found. I’m getting to the point of running out of superlatives for Angel. All I can say is give this record many listens.\n\nKey Tracks: All The Good Times, Big Time, Ghost On"

    "text": "4. Black Midi: Hellfire\nI was always on the cusp of really liking Black Midi but there was always something about their music that was just a touch too inaccessible for me. They always had cool experimental jazz and rock ideas but I just could never quite get into it. On “Hellfire” they manage to find the perfect balance between their wild experimental art rock with some truly beautiful moments of jazz. The album opens with the title track, which feels like an introduction to what you’ll hear on the record as it transitions into the masterpiece that is “Sugar/Tzu”. The track opens with a boxing announcer getting you ready for the craziness that is about to ensue. The song the sprints into outrageous arpeggios and jazz played a rapid pace. The song ends with horns erupting and some unbelievable drums lines. It then cleanly transitions in the equally crazy “Eat Men Eat”. Its baffling how many musical ideas this band manages to fit into a pretty short album (39 minutes in total) without ever feeling unfocused or forced. “The Race is About to Begin” is case study in this, shifting in and out of crazy guitar riffs and unhinged vocal deliveries, before settling into something akin to a lullaby. “Still” is among the sweeter moments on the record with some wonderful acoustic guitar, especially around the 2 minute mark. “Dangerous Liaisons” plays almost like a jazz standard, with gorgeous horn sections and piano, which would feel almost out of place on the record if wasn’t Black Midi playing. This is one of the most ambitious records released in 2022 and they really just nail it. It’s a record that a lot of people man not get into right away, but there is some many cool things going on, its absolutely worth spending time with.\n\nKey Tracks: Sugar/Tzu, The Race is About to Begin, Still"

    "text": "3. Ethel Cain: Preacher’s Daughter\nTrigger warning for some pretty heavy stuff on this record. My first impressions when this record came out were fairly positive. It was a slowburn kind of record with some cool studio production and pretty distinctive vocalist in Hayden Silas Anhedönia. But there was just an extraordinary buzz in the online music communities I’m involved with that I just wasn’t seen. As I was relistening to this record as I was getting ready to start my list, I decided to do a little more research on the album and really study the lyrics. I was shocked at what I found. For starters, I didn’t recognize this was considered a slowcore record, which allowed me to approach the record from another angle. But the real change was learning about the story within the album. This story follows Ethel, a daughter of preacher in rural southern town. “American Teenager” serves a character development, exploring Ethel’s desire to leave her hometown in search of something more, trying to heal from the end of a relationship. The album only gets more somber from here, on “House in Nebraska”, dealing with the crushing loneliness of her love abandoning her in the very same town she wants out of. She does eventually leave but ends up with a incredibly toxic and violent man on “Western Nights”, who eventually dies at the hands of the police during a bank robbery. The A side closes on “Family Tree”, as Ethel explores the likely sexual assault from her father and the complicated feelings between her hatred for him and yet unable to not love him anyway. You think Ethel as finally found true love in “Thoroughfare” as she travels to California with a kind stranger named Isiah, before falling in love with him. But the rug is ripped from under the listener, as Ethel is drugged up and pimped out on “Gibson Girl”. She begins to hallucinate on the dark, industrial song “Ptolemaea” as confronts the demons before her. Ethel screaming “Stop” is gives me chills every time I hear. On “August Underground” Ethel attempts to escape from Isaiah but to no avail, and is eventually killed by his hands, represented by the piano interlude “Televangelism” representing her ascent to heaven. Ethel on the closing two tracks comes terms with her death, worrying about her mother never learning about what happened to her, as Isaiah cannibalizes her body (yes you read that right). I don’t know if I’ve ever had an album give such visceral reaction before. The terror that Ethel faces just leaves a pit in my stomach. I wouldn’t say this album is “enjoyable” (though it is beautiful). But it’s a true work of art that I think won’t be matched for a while. It’s a tough listen, but one worth going through.\n\nKey Tracks: Ptolemaea, Strangers, Televangelism, Hard Times"

    "text": "2. Big Thief: Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe You\nThis is probably a good album to listen to after the Ethel Cain record….. I’m running out of words to describe what an amazing band Big Thief is. They just continue to release incredible record after incredible record. I’ve heard a lot people get excited that Big Thief released a country album, but honestly does this is a disservice. They cover all kinds of ground in the indie-folk and singer songwriter realm, from traditional Americana, to more experimental indie-folk, blue grass and more. I think the best comparison is maybe The Beatles’s “The White Album”, but only in the sense of the long tracklist with its sprawling sounds. The album opens sweetly, with the simple indie-folk song “Change” that has this delightful guitar solo from their lead guitarist, Buck Meek. In then transitions into the frantic “Time Escaping”, with a cacophony of sounds. “Spud Infinity” is this great blue grass song, complete a jaw harp (which required the funniest google search to figure out what the hell it was called). The album then goes into my favorite on the album “Certainty”. Its such a simple little song, but its so playful, and I just adore Adrianne Lenker’ss vocal performance on it and the lose harmonies from Buck. Big Thief produce such a crazy sound on “Little Things” with echo acoustic guitars layered by one of my favorite ever guitar performances from Buck. There doesn’t seem to be a ton of song structure to it, but it just works so well. It then transitions perfectly into the criminally brief “Heavy Bend”, with it’s plucky guitar and crisp drumbeat. I’ve talked about a lot of songs already and I’m not even halfway through the tracklist which just shows how much incredibly good music is on this album. The second half opens with amazing bluegrass tune “Red Moon” where Adrianne really leans into the twang in her vocal delivery. “No Reason” is another favorite of my, with the stunning flute solo on the bridge of the song and the lovely camrodory of the band as they together sing “come together”. “12,000” lines isa peaceful folk tune with fantastic vocal performance from Adrianne. Then there is “Simulation Swarm”, a catchy indie-folk tune that has this intrigue and mystery to it, as crescendos and backs off throughout the song, and feels like its destined to become a fan favorite. The album closes with one more country track, “Blue Lightning” with great messy lead guitars from Buck again, acting a perfect way to bring all of this together. This record has 20 songs and runs from 1 hour and 20 minutes. And yet, it doesn’t drag even a little bit. There is such comfort to how Big Thief approach this work. Its peaceful, playful, friendly, and above all, amazing executed. I dare say this is their best work yet and album that I will come back to time and time again.\n\nKey Tracks: Certainty, Reasons, Simulation Swarm, Little Things"

    "text": "1. Black Country New Road: Ants from Up There\nIt was going to take something pretty damn special to beat Big Thief’s latest release; Black Country, New Road have done just that. It’s honestly pretty hard to describe how much I love this record. I’ve just listened to some many times this year. It’s a pretty substantial departure from the post-punk approach they took on their terrific debut “For the first time”, opting for a chamber pop type sound instead. This allows for each of the instruments to have more profound role on the record and they put that to good use. The “Intro” starts like their first album, a fun instrumental but rather than a jam, serves a introduction to the album’s sound instead. It transitions into the almost silly “Chaos Space Marines” with dramatic piano and saxophones blasting as the song drives forward. It just sounds like the band is having such fun with this track. It then goes into the amazing “Concorde”, containing the understated iconic vocals from Isaac Wood. I just love how the saxophone and keyboard harmonizes on the second half of the song before it builds an emotional climax. “Bread Song” contains more rising saxophones and simple drums and guitar strums. A big highlight of the record falls on “Good Will Hunting”, with a pound of synth keys bringing you into the song. The way Issace sing “she has Billie Ellish style, moving to Berlin for a little while” just sounds so cool in his baritone voice. The front half of the album contains the shorter, more single type songs, but the real magic is on the back half. The B-side starts with the truly remarkable “The Place Where He Inserted the Blade”, my favorite song of 2022. It opens with somber piano chords and a breathtaking flute before Issac opens with the lines “your scared of the world where you’re needed”. Issac then belts the lines that I just love to sing along to “How come every time I try to make lunch for anyone else in my head, I get lost dreaming of you, and you come to me”. It’s just a line that gets stuck in your head. On the first chorus, the flute remains present, but is then replaced by a saxophone on the second first, giving the song more power. After the second verse, the whole band comes in seeing along to the melody, a moment that always overwhelms me emotionally. We then go into the 9 minute “Snow Globe”, a slow burn song with motif-esque guitar lines and a swelling violin part. There is some pretty incredible percussion on the back half of the track that really show case that the talent of the drummer/percussionist. Finally we get to the epic finale that is “Basketball Shoes”, the only song fitting to end this masterpiece. This 12 minute journey begins with instruments entering the song one by one, with a gorgeous harmonies between the saxophone and violinist. Issac the comes with hushed vocals to accompany the beautiful instrumentation surrounding him. The song the quickly transitions to post-punk sound familar on their first album, but only for brief moment. Each instrument the plays a singular note in order before erupting together playing the same melody. The song then builds tension for the big finale, with echoing drums and Isacc lamenting “in my bedsheets are now wet, with Charlie I pray to forget”. The band then just unleashes, giving everything they got as they sing together one last time. Its such a perfect end to a perfect album. This album hits me quite a bit harder following the news that Issac Woods left the band to tend to his mental health. This album almost feels like a goodbye in many ways. Still, I hope Issac receives the help he needs and can live a happy life. It goes without saying that this album is my front runner for not just album of the year, but album of the decade. It’s been a lot time since a piece of music has resonated with me as much as the work did. It’s something truly special.\n\nKey Tracks: The Place Where He Inserted the Blade, Basketball Shoes, Good Will Hunting, Concorde, basically the whole album"

    "text": "Cards on the table: the year of 2024 was probably the year I listened to the least amount of music in a long time. In fact, I was debating if I was even going to bother making the list this year. In my defense, a LOT happened, which led to a lot of distractions. In April, I permanently moved into an apartment in Brooklyn with my partner, Karen, after doing the long-distance thing for more than 2 years. I then spent the summer writing my PhD dissertation at the University of Albany and successfully defended it in August; officially making me Dr. Larry. Not long after I accepted a postdoctoral research scientist position at the NASA’s Goddard Institute of Space Studies with Columbia University’s Center for Climate Systems Research to become a climate modeler. Honestly, 2024 was shaping up to be pretty amazing. Then the election happened. I won’t go into much detail on it as I doubt people care much of what I think. All I say is that I pretty worried for the next four years; things are likely to really suck for a while, especially for immigrants, trans people, Ukrainians, and Palestinians.\nComing back to the music, I decided it was important to make the list, as it is something I truly enjoy doing. I want to recapture my love of music in 2025, and hopefully add more to the site (he says to himself every year…). Despite not listening to as much music as I would have liked, there was still a ton of stuff I absolutely loved! My biggest regret is that there is a ton of stuff I just didn’t get around to. It was a big year for the pop girlies (ie Chappel Roan, Sabrina Carpenter, Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo, and before you ask, no Chappel Roan isn’t on the list, as most of her hits are from 2023), further entrenching my opinion that pop music is in a really great place musically right now. Veteran groups and artists showed they still have a lot to contribute like Vampire Weekend, St Vincent, and Godspeed You! Black Emperor.\nBut above all, despite my dropoff in listening, I’m quite impressed with the list I put together. The ranking this year in particular was quite challenging as there were late releases this year, and albums that clicked after extra listens. As a compromise to myself, I’m keeping my top songs list to just 50 songs this year, as I feel like after song 50, the list would be mostly filler. I hope you can forgive me for the dropoff this. Here’s hoping to a renewed spirit into 2025.\nA fun side note, Karen and I saw “Wicked” in theaters and absolutely loved it. So much so, we thought it would be fun to include our favorite songs from the movie. In the true spirit of the list, here our 3 favorites songs from Wicked! Looking forward to part 2!"

The newest record from Godspeed You! Black Emperor is a hauntingly beautiful collection of instrumental post-rock tracks that I think capture the title of each song perfectly. It is a challenging but breath taking listen. “GREY RUBBLE, GREEN SHOOTS” is my favorite from the album, not only for its sounds, but its message; that even in all this horrific destruction, hope can still remain.\nAt time of writing, 45,788 Palestinians have died in Gaza since October 7th, 2023.

Jack White - no name\nSneaking into the list is year is the latest Jack White project. In all honesty, I have never been the biggest Jack White fan. But on this record, the raw garage rock sound he goes for on “no name” just freaking rips (the exact thing he told fans to do with vinyls that he gifted them). There is no denying his incredible ability to shred, and it is on full display here. There are so many amazing scratchy and raw riffs throughout “That’s How I’m Feeling”. I like the sentiment “It’s Rough On Rates (If You’re Asking)”; like if this are this bad for us, how bad is it for the rats? If you are need of loud garage rock record, look no further than here.\n\nKey Tracks: It’s Rough On Rats (If You’re Asking), That’s How I’m Feeling\n\n\n23. Angélica Garcia - Gemelo\nAngélica Garcia is a new artist discovery for me in 2024, with a fun and unique set of electronic tracks. This album represents the first album this artist wrote almost completely in Spanish. I love the rising vocal melody on the chorus “Color De Dolor”. I have been bumping “Gemini” all year, with its amazing refrain of “I see double everywhere I go”, that just sounds so cool to me. Highly recommend this album for any electronic fans out there.\n\nKey Tracks: Gemini, Color De Dolor\n\n\n22. Waxahatchee - Tigers Blood\nWaxahatchee is back with probably my favorite collection songs from Katie Crutchfield; spanning from country and folk. The album is full of country rock tracks like “Ice Cold” that serve a perfect background at any cookout.”Right Back to It” is such a fun and relaxing song that I feel like it declutters my brain, with it’s swaying tempo and perfectly loose harmonies with MJ Lenderman. A great album to reach for an a relaxed day outdoors.\n\nKey Tracks: Right Back to It, Ice Cold\n\n\n21. Iron and Wine - Light Verse\nI’m not sure there is another person that produces music that relaxes the soul more than Sam Beam of Iron and Wine. Here he continues his excellent catalog of indie-folk and singer-songwriter tracks that are perfect company for a rainy or lazy kind of day. There really isn’t a dud in the bunch, but my favorites include the slow-burn arrangements on “You Never Know” or the amazingly gentle “Taken By Surprise”.\n\nKey Tracks: You Never Know, Taken By Surprise\n\n\n20. SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE - YOU’LL HAVE TO LOSE SOMETHING\nWhat a strange album this is! SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE are back with their most eclectic and chaotic album yet. At times, 1 song feels like 10 songs, making it sometimes challenging to even know what track you currently are on. But beyond the chaos and dissonance, there are number of quite lovely moments that reward the listener for sticking around (which is a feature of music I tend to really enjoy). “STRANGER ALIVE” is a fantastic example of this, starting with faded drums and what sound like synths, before swinging into an off-center psychedelic rock song, before moving into sweet indie rock track. This is an album that may be hard to approach at first, but it will reward you greatly for sticking with it.\n\nKey Tracks: Stranger Alive, 1/500\n\n\n19. Lupe Fiasco - Samurai\nHip hop was a genre that I just didn’t spend enough time on this year, especially as some heavy weights dropped new records, including Kendrick Lamar and Tyler the Creator. However, Lupe Fiasco’s “Samurai” caught my attention. This album is loosely based on the idea of Amy Winehouse becoming a rap samurai (based on a quote from a 2015 documentary). It’s such a neat and fresh idea, especially from a rapper with as many credentials as Lupe Fiasco. The title track has this instantly infectious jazz beats and great flow. I love the silly jazz trumpet impressions on “No. 1 Headband”, coupled with a really sick drumbeat. This album is a super fun record, and coming in at the super approachable runtime of around 30 minutes, there is no excuse no to give this a spin.\n\nKey Tracks: Samurai, No. 1 Headband\n\n\n18. Nilüfer Yanya - My Method Actor\nNilüfer Yanya continues to make the amazingly interesting indie-rock/electronic music that sounds like nothing else out there. I just adore the strumming of the acoustic guitars on “Like I Say (I runaway)” before they explore into fuzzy electric guitars on the chorus. “Just A Western” is a great acoustic track with some great atmospheric production in the background to make things just a little spooky. Another fantastically unique record from Yanya.\n\nKey Tracks: Like I Say (I runaway), Just A Western\n\n\n17. Porter Robinson - SMILE! :D\nMy favorite electronic record of the year goes to the super sweet “SMILE! :D” by Porter Robinson. I was honestly surprised at how much I enjoyed this album, as sonically, its a bit too sugar sweet. But there is sincerity in the execution that just make things work for me. I love how digital “Knock Yourself Out XD” sounds, like a anthropomorphic computer wrote the track (in fun way, not crappy AI slop). “Cheerleader” is a fantastic dance track that feels an electric version of the “Great Escape”, which gives this silly nostalgia vibe to it that I really love. This album is full of brightness and optimism, even in it’s sadder and more vulnerable moments. Looking forward to hearing more from Porter!\n\nKey Tracks: Cheerleader, Knock Yourself Out XD\n\n\n16. The Lemon Twigs - A Dream Is All We Know\nThe Lemon Twigs are honestly a band that I had been sleeping on a bit. Not long after I had finished my 2023 list, I noticed that their 2023 release “Everything Harmony” was Anthony Fantano’s 10th favorite album of the year, which surprised me so much I had to go listen and I became immediately frustrated that this album was in my blindspot. When they released their newest project “A Dream Is All We Know”, I made sure to not make the same mistake, and to great benefit. The album (much like their last release) is filled with 70s soft-rock nostalgia that I feel anyone a fan of that era of music would greatly enjoy. The due fronted of brother’s Brian and Michael D’Addario thread the needle of capturing the essence of their clear influences (think the Beatles, The Beach Boys) while not being a complete ripoff. This largely comes down to how excellent the arrangements, making the music feel more like an appreciation rather than a copycat. My 2nd favorite song of the year “My Golden Years” feels perfectly engineered for a road trip, with it’s driving drum beat and delightfully intricate harmonies. “How Can I Love Her More” is a track that Brian Wilson himself would be proud, containing such an infectious chorus. Give this album a spin, if nothing else but improve your mood.\n\nKey Tracks: My Golden Years, How Can I Love Her More?\n\n\n15. St. Vincent - All Born Screaming\nSt. Vincent continues to show why she is such a big figure in the alternative-pop scene. Her work always feels so cinematic; look no further than the crazy album cover! I love the slight headfake the opening track, “Hell is Near”, does to you, starting with (what sounds like) timpanies and her vocals starting low, as if to build toward something epic, before it transitions into this slow, groovy rock track. Easily my favorite song on the record. “Broken Man” has these awesome heavy guitar lines that just hit so hard on the song. I maintain that Annie Clark is at her best when she is shredding. Another fantastic record to add to her already insane catalog.\n\nKey Tracks: Hell is Near, Broken Man\n\n\n14. Chelsea Wolfe - She Reaches Out to She Reaches Out To She\nIf you’re looking for a moody, dark album, look no further then Chelsea Wolfe’s excellent “She Reaches Out to She Reaches Out To She” (crazy album title by the way). This work is filled with synths, drum beats, and guitars that provide this aura and sense of foreboding that could soundtrack the creepiest horror film imaginable. “House of Self-Undoing” has this great driving drum line and fuzzy guitars that create this sense of tension that I just think is so cool. The closing track “Dusk” is a perfect closer, starting with this almost child-like melody to start, before closing with an enormous wall of guitars to bring things home. I’ve been aware of Chelsea Wolfe for a long time, but have never given her a real listen before. This album has me wanting to go back through her catalog, because if it sounds anything like this record, I’m already a fan.\n\nKey Tracks: Dusk, House of Self-Undoing\n\n\n13. Remi Wolf - Big Ideas\nRemi Wolf begins a string of indie-pop groups on this list releasing a ton of incredibly fun and danceable tracks. On “Big Ideas”, Wolf comes in hot with the incredibly funky track “Cinderella”, with its jangly guitars, bright horn section, and the utterly infectious refrain “me and the boys in the hotel lobby”. This album is just jammed backed indie-pop bangers that will just get stuck in your head. “Toro” remains one of my absolute favorite songs this year (and decade while were at it), with some pretty intricate instrumentation throughout the song. But the key moment is just how much Wolf kills the vocal line on the second verse, walking up her range until she’s at fully belting, with the instrumentation catching up to match her. God what a cool moment. “Alone in Miami” is another awesome vocal performance from Wolf, with almost bratty sound that suits the song perfectly. Remi Wolf is a star in the making and hope after “Big Ideas” she gets the attention she deserves.\n\nKey Tracks: Toro, Cinderella\n\n\n12. Clairo - Charm\nCaliro is back with another fantastic vibey record! I really enjoyed her previous work (Sling was my 8th favorite record in 2021), which felt like a bedroom pop album recorded in a log cabin. On “Charm”, she expands her to a slightly larger, almost jazz-lounge sound, filled with flutes, piano and a busier percussion. “Sexy to Someone” was a quick favorite for me, with the trilling clarinets and flutes on the verses and ringing guitar on the chorus. I particularly like how the phrase “oh I need a reason to get of the house” flows on the chorus. “Juna” is another clear standout, that is as sleepy as it is funky, with that amazing crescendo on the synth line found throughout the song. While the high points on “Sling” are bit higher for me, there is a fantastic consistency to this project, making it her most focused work to date. I’m super eager to hear how her work evolves from here!\n\nKey Tracks: Sexy to Someone, Juna\n\n\n11. Rubblebucket - Year of The Banana\nEvery since I heard the blasting of a baritone saxophone (my instrument in high school band) on “IF U C My Enemies“, I knew I was going to love this band. And they absolutely do not disappoint on”Year of The Banana”, their most fun and consistent work yet. The album is full of indie-pop gems, but contains depth lyrically, as the album is based around the end of the relationship between Kalmia Traver and Alex Toth. “Stella The Begonia” opens the album amazingly, with the saxophone front and center and a great bridge in the middle of the song. However, “Rattlesnake” is the real show stopper on the album. It starts out as what seems to be a fairly straightforward funk song, before evolving into life on the lines “you’re so far away” and transitioning into a truly awesome synth solo. It’s such an amazingly bright arrangement. There are so many great horn sections throughout the record, like on “Morning Glory Blanket” and “Boomerang” that add so much to each song without overdoing it. This is my favorite work by these two to date, and I honestly was a bit bummed I couldn’t squeeze them into the top 10 this year.\n\nKey Tracks: Rattlesnack, Stella The Begonia\n\n\n10. Adrianne Lenker - Bright Future\nWhat more can be said about Adrianne Lenker. At this point, between their solo material and work with Big Thief, Lenker is one of this generations most talented songwriters. Over the past few days writing this review, I’ve had a hard time putting into words exactly how this album makes me feel. I then found this really great New York Times interview they gave this past year and a line struck me; “if you can really allow yourself to feel it, your sadness doesn’t have to be so scary. You wouldn’t feel it if you didn’t have this immense care”. This album brings a sense of melancholy to me that I think I’ve had a hard time processing in the past and I think that’s why its been impactful. Ultimately, feelings are good thing as it means you living. This is one of those albums that get better with each listen as you unpack it more and more. “Sadness As A Gift” is immensely beautiful, as it balances the sadness involved at the end of relationship with a lovely sense of optimism over a really nice violin part. “No Machine” is another classic Lenker acoustic track, with simple but touching refrain “I don’t know what I would do without you”. The closing track is very reminiscent to the excellent Big Thief song, Mary, as Lenker devastatingly describes her the complex feelings behind an likely ended relationship. This is another special record from Lenker, and I think my favorite from their solo work. Lenker is probably my favorite songwriter working today, and this album is no exception.\n\nKey Tracks: Sadness as A Gift, No Machine, Ruined\n\n\n9. Jessica Pratt - Here In The Pitch\nAn important aspect of music for me is an artist’s ability to use space effectively; whether that be going for enormous sounds on rock or metal album, or paying attention to the subtle details on smaller arrangements. Jessica Pratt is a master of the second aspect, writing these fragile 60s folk songs with that use space so efficiently. For instance, on the opening track “Life Is”; it is such a simple little arrangement, with a strumming acoustic guitars, some light drum fills, and the occasional vocal harmonies surrounding Pratt. Yet, the song feels full of life, as the her attention to detail makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts. It certainly helps that Pratt has amazing knack for writing these amazing vocal melodies that get stuck in your head. I’m absolutely in love with the melody on “Empire Never Know”, that is produced like she is singing directly to you in a vast hallway. The hushed piano line behind adds this slight bit of sadness to the song. Definitely one of my favorite songs of the year. The album closes what feels almost like a lullaby as Pratt recounts what seems to have been a really tough year, with lines like “cause I’m exactly what you said, and better off than dead. Can’t get me out of my own bed”. I have a number of big and bold albums throughout this list, so I’m glad I was able to find something a bit more subtle to balance things out. Despite its short runtime of 27 minutes, this album is full of little surprises and things I notice with each successive listen. I highly recommend you listen to this on headphones to catch the little tricks shes uses, and preferably late at night.\n\nKey Tracks: Empires Never Know, Life Is, The Last Year\n\n\n8. MJ Lenderman - Manning Fireworks\nIf you need a slacker country-rock album, look no further than the excellent “Manning Fireworks” from MJ Lenderman. Between the loose vocals from Lenderman, laid back vibes, and at times, garage rock guitar tones, this album contains a bit of magic that is hard to state clearly in words. The best I can come up with is that this album sounds like porch beers in the summer; and I love porch beers. The album opens with meandering acoustic guitar and loose fiddle playing on the title track to ease you in. “Joker Lips”, my personal favorite on the record, picks up the pace just a tad, with a melodic country guitar that I just love so much. While the subject matter isn’t particularly happy, there is a comfort to it that I have come to appreciate this year. “Wristwatch” , has this amazing wall of fuzzy guitars, pedal steel, a symbol heavy drums. I also immensely enjoy the concept of bragging about having “a beach house up in Buffalo”, if its meant to be tongue in cheek. “She’s Leaving You” almost reminds of Gin Blossoms song, which I honestly don’t hate. The album ends in a way I didn’t quite expect; the 10 minute track “Barking At The Moon”, containing another slacker country rock gem in the first half, before transitioning into an ambient song with guitar feedback, that I think is a terrific way to end things. What can I say, this album was probably always going to work for me, with the garage rock sounds and loose lead vocals. But the execution is so excellent in many subtle ways, it deserves its spot in the top 10.\n\nKey Tracks: Joker Lips, She’s Leaving You, Wristwatch\n\n\n7. Father John Misty - Mahashmashana\nI would be lying if I said the release date of this album didn’t annoy me just slightly. When making these lists, I always have to have a rough cutoff date, as I won’t have enough time to listen to an album for fair consideration. But as big Father John Misty fan, I had it a quick listen. And I immediately fell in love with the opening track, with it’s enormous strings and piano chords that immediately brought me back to his best album “I Love You Honeybear”. “Mahashmashana” contains some of his most inspired and interesting songwriting of Josh Tillman’s career. “She Cleans Up” completely switches things up, with electric guitars and cowbell to boot! “Metal Health” is a beautiful big band arrangement with lovely flutes and saxophone throughout, coupled with some darker themes discussing how there is no higher goal of society (or at least Western culture) than mental health, describing it as “a less pathetic cry for help”. The track “I Guess Time Just Makes Fools of Us All” is about as groovy as Tillman has ever gotten, despite the grim subject matter. Of all the albums on this list, this probably the placement I had the hardest time with, but I’m quite convinced this is top 10 worthy. Despite it’s fairly depressing vibes, this album contains some of the most stunning musical arrangements written this year, and that alone makes the album worth a listen.\n\nKey Tracks: Mahashmashana, Mental Health, I Guess Time Just Makes Fools of Us All\n\n\n6. Knocked Loose - You Won’t Go Before You’re Supposed To\nThis is the first time that a metal album has made one of my lists and there can be only one good reason for that; IT FUCKING RIPS. Metal is a genre I tended not to love in the past, as the sound and aesthetics can be a bit cheesy to me sometimes. However, there is the rawness to how Knocked Loose approach their music on “You Won’t Go Before You’re Supposed To” that I just absolutely love. Like other albums I listened to this year, this albums comes in at shorter runtime of 28 minutes, but the album flows so smoothly and covers so many different sounds and tempos that it feels like a full meal. The thing that standouts is the insane percussion, with constant tempo changes that keep you on your toes. The album opens quietly with bells in the distance; as if its your last moment of peace before the album melts your face. There isn’t a dud on the record, but “Suffocate” is a real standout, with an amazing feature from Poppy. I’m not sure I’ve ever heard a screamo duet, but man does work to great effect here. “The Calm That Keeps You Awake” is a truly terrifying concept for a song title, that has these great sludgy guitar lines that match the vocalists, and amazing clattering drums that add so much to the song. “Blinding Faith” is another fantastic track that has this super insane breakdown, which transitions amazing into the closer on “Sit and Mourn”. This album has shifted my views I’ve had on metal and has made looking for more metal in 2025 a big priority.\n\nKey Tracks: Blinding Faith, Suffocate, The Calm That Keeps You Awake\n\n\n5. Billie Eilish - HIT HARD AND SOFT\nIt has been so cool to see Billie and her brother, Finneas, improve as musicians with each subsequent release in their already illustrious careers. What I have always appreciated about their music is the subtlety they brought to the world of pop music, a genre that isn’t exactly known for that. On “HIT HARD AND SOFT”, they expand their sound, but at the right times, which makes the louder moments feel so much bigger. The album opens with a familiar sound on “SKINNY”, with a sparse arrangement, but even this track feels bigger, with layered harmonies and string arrangements. I love the transition into the incredibly fun “LUNCH”, which has this amazing wobbly guitar fill that I am obsessed with. My personal favorite track on the record, “CHIHIRO” (a reference to the character in the classic movie “Spirited Away”), is this excellent synth pop song with amazing synth line in the middle of the track that goes harder than it needs to. I also really like the simple but effective bass line in the background that makes itself just obvious enough to drive the song forward. Probably the thing that sticks out most to me is how amazing the vocal performances from Billie. From her cascading falsetto on “CHIHIRO” to the belting on the explosive “THE GREATEST”. “THE GREASTEST” works so well because it feels earned; there is enough space between the low and quiet points to make songs like “THE GREATEST” hit hard (and based on the album title was by design). L’AMOUT DE MA VIE is this great simple Billie song that is a little sad and a little sweet, with another great vocal performance. But at the end it transitions into this auto-tuned synth pop section that my brain rejected at first because it was so unexpected, but it’s grown on me a ton (and has no right to be as good as it is). I knew this album was a top 10 contender after the first listen, which was so cool for me. This is probably the highest a pop record has ranked on my lists thus far and it’s well deserved for my favorite pop artists in music right now. However, something tells me they will get more important accolades this year…\n\nKey Tracks: CHIHIRO, THE GREATEST, L`AMOUR DE MA VIE\n\n\n4. Geordie Greep - The New Sound\nThe release of this record was bittersweet. On one hand, Black Midi announced an indefinite hiatus (their album “Hellfire” was my 4th favorite album of 2022, in probably the most competitive list I’ve ever made), which bummed me out to no end. On the other hand, the lead singer, Geordie Greep, released the excellent “The New Sound” that will likely scratch the itch of many Black Midi fans. However, while the identity of Black Midi can be heard in these tracks, this is sonically distinct, leaning more into the jazz sounds with quite a bit of samba. The opening track “Blues” would feel at home on a Black Midi record, with many of the intricate guitar riffs, off the beaten path melodies, and the rapid almost ramblings of Greep, almost as a way to help fans transition into, well, The New Sound. “Terra” is the wonderful samba track that makes you want to dance (something I never expected from Greep to be perfectly honest). There is so much amazing musicianship throughout the record, whether is its the guitar work, the horns in the big band numbers, or the incredible percussion. But don’t worry, there is plenty of dissonance and experimentation found throughout the record, like on “Walk Up” or the oddly sweet “Motorbike”. The album reaches a climax on the 12 minute slowburn “The Magician”, which opens sweetly strum acoustic guitars and harmonicas, with the track slowly falling apart towards the end. While I’m incredibly sad to Black Midi taking a long-term break at a minimum, if Geordie Greep (or other band members) put out music of this caliber, I think I will manage okay.\n\nKey Tracks: The Magician, Terra, Blues\n\n\n3. Vampire Weekend - Only God Was Above Us\nOne of the most influential (if not most influential) indie rock band of the 2000s are back with my personal favorite record since their debut. While there were tracks on there previous album, “Father of the Bride” that I liked a lot, the 18 song tracklist led to a lot of throwaways that ultimately harmed the listening experience. On “Only God Was Above Us”, the project feels much more focused on creating an incredibly fun record that brings back the strengths of the group. The opening track “Ice Cream Piano” explodes with colorful sound to bring you headfirst into the album, before wonderfully transitioning into “Classical”, containing a battle between intricate melodic guitar riffs and siren-like slide guitar (which is a feature of much of this album). “Capricorn” is classic Vampire Weekend, with such an infectious and catchy vocal melody that makes you wonder how more artists don’t try to replicate it; one of my very favorite songs this past year. A thing that really stands out to me on this record is the degree of musicianship from this group. Not only is there is tremendous guitar throughout, but some truly fantastic piano, like on “Connect”. The siren guitar returns very suddenly on “Gen-X Cops” in a way that would jolt anyone awake (and maybe a good track to skip during a nap). The closing track “Hope” serves as a perfect bookend for the record, recreating many of the sounds heard throughout the record, before taking just slightly harder edge (at least for harder for Vampire Weekend). It is truly extraordinary how this band has been able to release so much amazing music in their career and can continue continue this excellence in their career. It is possible that “Only God Was Above Us” doesn’t reach the same heights as some of their earlier work, but a certain subset of fans (myself included) are likely to look back at this record as some of their best work.\n\nKey Tracks: Capricorn, Classical, Prep-School Gangsters, Gen-X Cops\n\n\n2. Magdalena Bay - Imaginal Disk\nIt was going to take a lot of Magdalena Bay to outdo their spectacular 2021 debut record “Mercurial World”, and they somehow have done it. The duo of Mica Tenebaum and Matthew Lewin manage to strike this perfect balance of super catchy and accessible synth and dance pop, while adding plenty of experimentation and intricate arrangements to prevent things from getting stale. Beyond this, while each track stands well on it’s own, a lot of detail was put into how the album flows, making tracks be able to stand on their own while simultaneously rewarding listeners for investing in the project as a whole. For all the different sounds they introduce throughout the record, often my favorite part is the simple use of the keyboard, like on “Death and Romance”. That piano just sticks out over the other instruments and just love how it sounds. “Watching T.V.” at times is quite a beautiful emotional song, letting for just allowing a brief moment of space for Tenebaum’s vocals, before erupting into a wall of synths and crashing drums. Somehow, the record gets better as you move through, shifting tempos and sounds from track to track. If you want to dance, then look no further than the absolutely funky “Love is Everywhere” or the discoey “Cry for Me”. They even end the album brilliantly on “The Ballad of Matt & Mica” with a fun motif back to the excellent opening track. The real strength of this record isn’t just how absolutely fun it is, but it is the little details throughout the arrangements. I keep finding little things in the songs where I have to sick back and think “man, I really like what they added there”. On the final track, I was really charmed by the lyric “two Kids in a new town, baby. Is it my turn? Small-time fame. Bang-Bang and a happy ending”. If this album gets even half the attention it deserves, they are probably on their way to more than small-time fame.\n\nKey Tracks: Death and Romance, Watching T.V., Love Is Everywhere, Image\n\n\n1. Cindy Lee - Diamond Jubilee\nI struggle to put words down that show how much I adore and admire this record. While it may be true that life events made it harder for me to listen to music this past year, I would be lying if I didn’t say that part of the problem was that I just found myself coming back to this album over and over. As much as anything, this record felt like a companion when I found myself writing and coding a lot during the summer of 2024. For long time readers (if they exist…), they will recognize Cindy Lee (the drag alter-ego of Partick Flegel) from my 2020 list, with their excellent, incredibly distorted album lo-fi record What’s Tonight to Eternity. While it’s a beautiful record (Heavy Metal is a major standout for me), the heavy use of reverb and distortion makes the album a bit tough to approach if you aren’t a lo-fi music fan (and often I’m not). For the Cindy Lee discography, this is a much easier starting point.\nThe magic behind this record is hard to fully put my finger on. Flegel’s songwriting is squarely centered around 50s-60s nostalgia with softrock, soul, and doo-wop sounds found throughout. But the production makes the record feel like a time-capsule of a bygone era, or better yet, as Pitchfork magazine perfectly described it as “may be the greatest radio station you’ve ever come across“. There is no overarching theme or message behind the record, just a enourmous collection of songs that feel queued about by a DJ from a different time, one that brings me nothing but comfort. There are plenty of artists out their that wear their influences on their sleeves (including on this list!), but the thing that takes this record another level is the guitar playing. On the opening and title track, there is this great little rhythmic riff that serves both as great foundation for the song and as what is to come.\nOn tracks like “Kingdom Come” or “All I Want is You”, as Flegel dances up and down the neck of their guitar. Very quickly Flegel has become one my absolute favorite guitarists working in music right now. Beyond their virtuosic guitar ability, great use of distortion is used on many tracks, transitioning from sweet, melodic tones on “If You Hear Me Crying” before diving headfirst into screeching feedback. Such a cool moment. If you weren’t already impressed, just about every instrument (with a handful of small exceptions) and the production were also handled by Flegel, really making this their own masterpiece. The tracklist comes in at a whopping 32 tracks, with about 2 hours worth of music, but don’t let that intimidate you. There is so much to love about this record and truly hope you give it a good chance. Next time you have a mundane task ahead of you, throw Diamond Jubilee on. You may find yourself repeatedly stopping your task to take what is happening.\nAn important sidenote, this album is not available on traditional streaming platforms. It can be found on youtube, or via bandcamp.\n&lt;a href=\"https://cindylee.bandcamp.com/album/diamond-jubilee\"&gt;Diamond Jubilee by Cindy Lee&lt;/a&gt;\nKey Tracks: Kingdom Come, Diamond Jubilee, If You Hear Me Crying, Demon Bitch"

There is no denying his incredible ability to shred, and it is on full display here. There are so many amazing scratchy and raw riffs throughout “That’s How I’m Feeling”. I like the sentiment “It’s Rough On Rates (If You’re Asking)”; like if this are this bad for us, how bad is it for the rats? If you are need of loud garage rock record, look no further than here.\n\nKey Tracks: It’s Rough On Rats (If You’re Asking), That’s How I’m Feeling"

At times, 1 song feels like 10 songs, making it sometimes challenging to even know what track you currently are on. But beyond the chaos and dissonance, there are number of quite lovely moments that reward the listener for sticking around (which is a feature of music I tend to really enjoy). “STRANGER ALIVE” is a fantastic example of this, starting with faded drums and what sound like synths, before swinging into an off-center psychedelic rock song, before moving into sweet indie rock track. This is an album that may be hard to approach at first, but it will reward you greatly for sticking with it.\n\nKey Tracks: Stranger Alive, 1/500"

It’s such a neat and fresh idea, especially from a rapper with as many credentials as Lupe Fiasco. The title track has this instantly infectious jazz beats and great flow. I love the silly jazz trumpet impressions on “No. 1 Headband”, coupled with a really sick drumbeat. This album is a super fun record, and coming in at the super approachable runtime of around 30 minutes, there is no excuse no to give this a spin.\n\nKey Tracks: Samurai, No. 1 Headband"

I was honestly surprised at how much I enjoyed this album, as sonically, its a bit too sugar sweet. But there is sincerity in the execution that just make things work for me. I love how digital “Knock Yourself Out XD” sounds, like a anthropomorphic computer wrote the track (in fun way, not crappy AI slop). “Cheerleader” is a fantastic dance track that feels an electric version of the “Great Escape”, which gives this silly nostalgia vibe to it that I really love. This album is full of brightness and optimism, even in it’s sadder and more vulnerable moments. Looking forward to hearing more from Porter!\n\nKey Tracks: Cheerleader, Knock Yourself Out XD"

    "text": "16. The Lemon Twigs - A Dream Is All We Know\nThe Lemon Twigs are honestly a band that I had been sleeping on a bit. Not long after I had finished my 2023 list, I noticed that their 2023 release “Everything Harmony” was Anthony Fantano’s 10th favorite album of the year, which surprised me so much I had to go listen and I became immediately frustrated that this album was in my blindspot. When they released their newest project “A Dream Is All We Know”, I made sure to not make the same mistake, and to great benefit. The album (much like their last release) is filled with 70s soft-rock nostalgia that I feel anyone a fan of that era of music would greatly enjoy. The due fronted of brother’s Brian and Michael D’Addario thread the needle of capturing the essence of their clear influences (think the Beatles, The Beach Boys) while not being a complete ripoff. This largely comes down to how excellent the arrangements, making the music feel more like an appreciation rather than a copycat. My 2nd favorite song of the year “My Golden Years” feels perfectly engineered for a road trip, with it’s driving drum beat and delightfully intricate harmonies. “How Can I Love Her More” is a track that Brian Wilson himself would be proud, containing such an infectious chorus. Give this album a spin, if nothing else but improve your mood.\n\nKey Tracks: My Golden Years, How Can I Love Her More?"

Easily my favorite song on the record. “Broken Man” has these awesome heavy guitar lines that just hit so hard on the song. I maintain that Annie Clark is at her best when she is shredding. Another fantastic record to add to her already insane catalog.\n\nKey Tracks: Hell is Near, Broken Man"

This work is filled with synths, drum beats, and guitars that provide this aura and sense of foreboding that could soundtrack the creepiest horror film imaginable. “House of Self-Undoing” has this great driving drum line and fuzzy guitars that create this sense of tension that I just think is so cool. The closing track “Dusk” is a perfect closer, starting with this almost child-like melody to start, before closing with an enormous wall of guitars to bring things home. I’ve been aware of Chelsea Wolfe for a long time, but have never given her a real listen before. This album has me wanting to go back through her catalog, because if it sounds anything like this record, I’m already a fan.\n\nKey Tracks: Dusk, House of Self-Undoing"

This album is just jammed backed indie-pop bangers that will just get stuck in your head. “Toro” remains one of my absolute favorite songs this year (and decade while were at it), with some pretty intricate instrumentation throughout the song. But the key moment is just how much Wolf kills the vocal line on the second verse, walking up her range until she’s at fully belting, with the instrumentation catching up to match her. God what a cool moment. “Alone in Miami” is another awesome vocal performance from Wolf, with almost bratty sound that suits the song perfectly. Remi Wolf is a star in the making and hope after “Big Ideas” she gets the attention she deserves.\n\nKey Tracks: Toro, Cinderella"

On “Charm”, she expands her to a slightly larger, almost jazz-lounge sound, filled with flutes, piano and a busier percussion. “Sexy to Someone” was a quick favorite for me, with the trilling clarinets and flutes on the verses and ringing guitar on the chorus. I particularly like how the phrase “oh I need a reason to get of the house” flows on the chorus. “Juna” is another clear standout, that is as sleepy as it is funky, with that amazing crescendo on the synth line found throughout the song. While the high points on “Sling” are bit higher for me, there is a fantastic consistency to this project, making it her most focused work to date.

And they absolutely do not disappoint on”Year of The Banana”, their most fun and consistent work yet. The album is full of indie-pop gems, but contains depth lyrically, as the album is based around the end of the relationship between Kalmia Traver and Alex Toth. “Stella The Begonia” opens the album amazingly, with the saxophone front and center and a great bridge in the middle of the song. However, “Rattlesnake” is the real show stopper on the album. It starts out as what seems to be a fairly straightforward funk song, before evolving into life on the lines “you’re so far away” and transitioning into a truly awesome synth solo. It’s such an amazingly bright arrangement. There are so many great horn sections throughout the record, like on “Morning Glory Blanket” and “Boomerang” that add so much to each song without overdoing it. This is my favorite work by these two to date, and I honestly was a bit bummed I couldn’t squeeze them into the top 10 this year.\n\nKey Tracks: Rattlesnack, Stella The Begonia"

At this point, between their solo material and work with Big Thief, Lenker is one of this generations most talented songwriters. Over the past few days writing this review, I’ve had a hard time putting into words exactly how this album makes me feel. I then found this really great New York Times interview they gave this past year and a line struck me; “if you can really allow yourself to feel it, your sadness doesn’t have to be so scary. You wouldn’t feel it if you didn’t have this immense care”. This album brings a sense of melancholy to me that I think I’ve had a hard time processing in the past and I think that’s why its been impactful. Ultimately, feelings are good thing as it means you living. This is one of those albums that get better with each listen as you unpack it more and more. “Sadness As A Gift” is immensely beautiful, as it balances the sadness involved at the end of relationship with a lovely sense of optimism over a really nice violin part. “No Machine” is another classic Lenker acoustic track, with simple but touching refrain “I don’t know what I would do without you”. The closing track is very reminiscent to the excellent Big Thief song, Mary, as Lenker devastatingly describes her the complex feelings behind an likely ended relationship. This is another special record from Lenker, and I think my favorite from their solo work. Lenker is probably my favorite songwriter working today, and this album is no exception.\n\nKey Tracks: Sadness as A Gift, No Machine, Ruined"

Jessica Pratt - Here In The Pitch\nAn important aspect of music for me is an artist’s ability to use space effectively; whether that be going for enormous sounds on rock or metal album, or paying attention to the subtle details on smaller arrangements. Jessica Pratt is a master of the second aspect, writing these fragile 60s folk songs with that use space so efficiently. For instance, on the opening track “Life Is”; it is such a simple little arrangement, with a strumming acoustic guitars, some light drum fills, and the occasional vocal harmonies surrounding Pratt. Yet, the song feels full of life, as the her attention to detail makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts. It certainly helps that Pratt has amazing knack for writing these amazing vocal melodies that get stuck in your head. I’m absolutely in love with the melody on “Empire Never Know”, that is produced like she is singing directly to you in a vast hallway. The hushed piano line behind adds this slight bit of sadness to the song. Definitely one of my favorite songs of the year. The album closes what feels almost like a lullaby as Pratt recounts what seems to have been a really tough year, with lines like “cause I’m exactly what you said, and better off than dead. Can’t get me out of my own bed”. I have a number of big and bold albums throughout this list, so I’m glad I was able to find something a bit more subtle to balance things out. Despite its short runtime of 27 minutes, this album is full of little surprises and things I notice with each successive listen. I highly recommend you listen to this on headphones to catch the little tricks shes uses, and preferably late at night.\n\nKey Tracks: Empires Never Know, Life Is, The Last Year"

Between the loose vocals from Lenderman, laid back vibes, and at times, garage rock guitar tones, this album contains a bit of magic that is hard to state clearly in words. The best I can come up with is that this album sounds like porch beers in the summer; and I love porch beers. The album opens with meandering acoustic guitar and loose fiddle playing on the title track to ease you in. “Joker Lips”, my personal favorite on the record, picks up the pace just a tad, with a melodic country guitar that I just love so much. While the subject matter isn’t particularly happy, there is a comfort to it that I have come to appreciate this year. “Wristwatch” , has this amazing wall of fuzzy guitars, pedal steel, a symbol heavy drums. I also immensely enjoy the concept of bragging about having “a beach house up in Buffalo”, if its meant to be tongue in cheek. “She’s Leaving You” almost reminds of Gin Blossoms song, which I honestly don’t hate. The album ends in a way I didn’t quite expect; the 10 minute track “Barking At The Moon”, containing another slacker country rock gem in the first half, before transitioning into an ambient song with guitar feedback, that I think is a terrific way to end things. What can I say, this album was probably always going to work for me, with the garage rock sounds and loose lead vocals. But the execution is so excellent in many subtle ways, it deserves its spot in the top 10.\n\nKey Tracks: Joker Lips, She’s Leaving You, Wristwatch"

But as big Father John Misty fan, I had it a quick listen. And I immediately fell in love with the opening track, with it’s enormous strings and piano chords that immediately brought me back to his best album “I Love You Honeybear”. “Mahashmashana” contains some of his most inspired and interesting songwriting of Josh Tillman’s career. “She Cleans Up” completely switches things up, with electric guitars and cowbell to boot! “Metal Health” is a beautiful big band arrangement with lovely flutes and saxophone throughout, coupled with some darker themes discussing how there is no higher goal of society (or at least Western culture) than mental health, describing it as “a less pathetic cry for help”. The track “I Guess Time Just Makes Fools of Us All” is about as groovy as Tillman has ever gotten, despite the grim subject matter. Of all the albums on this list, this probably the placement I had the hardest time with, but I’m quite convinced this is top 10 worthy. Despite it’s fairly depressing vibes, this album contains some of the most stunning musical arrangements written this year, and that alone makes the album worth a listen.\n\nKey Tracks: Mahashmashana, Mental Health, I Guess Time Just Makes Fools of Us All"

Metal is a genre I tended not to love in the past, as the sound and aesthetics can be a bit cheesy to me sometimes. However, there is the rawness to how Knocked Loose approach their music on “You Won’t Go Before You’re Supposed To” that I just absolutely love. Like other albums I listened to this year, this albums comes in at shorter runtime of 28 minutes, but the album flows so smoothly and covers so many different sounds and tempos that it feels like a full meal. The thing that standouts is the insane percussion, with constant tempo changes that keep you on your toes. The album opens quietly with bells in the distance; as if its your last moment of peace before the album melts your face. There isn’t a dud on the record, but “Suffocate” is a real standout, with an amazing feature from Poppy. I’m not sure I’ve ever heard a screamo duet, but man does work to great effect here. “The Calm That Keeps You Awake” is a truly terrifying concept for a song title, that has these great sludgy guitar lines that match the vocalists, and amazing clattering drums that add so much to the song. “Blinding Faith” is another fantastic track that has this super insane breakdown, which transitions amazing into the closer on “Sit and Mourn”. This album has shifted my views I’ve had on metal and has made looking for more metal in 2025 a big priority.\n\nKey Tracks: Blinding Faith, Suffocate, The Calm That Keeps You Awake"

    "text": "5. Billie Eilish - HIT HARD AND SOFT\nIt has been so cool to see Billie and her brother, Finneas, improve as musicians with each subsequent release in their already illustrious careers. What I have always appreciated about their music is the subtlety they brought to the world of pop music, a genre that isn’t exactly known for that. On “HIT HARD AND SOFT”, they expand their sound, but at the right times, which makes the louder moments feel so much bigger. The album opens with a familiar sound on “SKINNY”, with a sparse arrangement, but even this track feels bigger, with layered harmonies and string arrangements. I love the transition into the incredibly fun “LUNCH”, which has this amazing wobbly guitar fill that I am obsessed with. My personal favorite track on the record, “CHIHIRO” (a reference to the character in the classic movie “Spirited Away”), is this excellent synth pop song with amazing synth line in the middle of the track that goes harder than it needs to. I also really like the simple but effective bass line in the background that makes itself just obvious enough to drive the song forward. Probably the thing that sticks out most to me is how amazing the vocal performances from Billie. From her cascading falsetto on “CHIHIRO” to the belting on the explosive “THE GREATEST”. “THE GREASTEST” works so well because it feels earned; there is enough space between the low and quiet points to make songs like “THE GREATEST” hit hard (and based on the album title was by design). L’AMOUT DE MA VIE is this great simple Billie song that is a little sad and a little sweet, with another great vocal performance. But at the end it transitions into this auto-tuned synth pop section that my brain rejected at first because it was so unexpected, but it’s grown on me a ton (and has no right to be as good as it is). I knew this album was a top 10 contender after the first listen, which was so cool for me. This is probably the highest a pop record has ranked on my lists thus far and it’s well deserved for my favorite pop artists in music right now. However, something tells me they will get more important accolades this year…\n\nKey Tracks: CHIHIRO, THE GREATEST, L`AMOUR DE MA VIE"

On one hand, Black Midi announced an indefinite hiatus (their album “Hellfire” was my 4th favorite album of 2022, in probably the most competitive list I’ve ever made), which bummed me out to no end. On the other hand, the lead singer, Geordie Greep, released the excellent “The New Sound” that will likely scratch the itch of many Black Midi fans. However, while the identity of Black Midi can be heard in these tracks, this is sonically distinct, leaning more into the jazz sounds with quite a bit of samba. The opening track “Blues” would feel at home on a Black Midi record, with many of the intricate guitar riffs, off the beaten path melodies, and the rapid almost ramblings of Greep, almost as a way to help fans transition into, well, The New Sound. “Terra” is the wonderful samba track that makes you want to dance (something I never expected from Greep to be perfectly honest). There is so much amazing musicianship throughout the record, whether is its the guitar work, the horns in the big band numbers, or the incredible percussion. But don’t worry, there is plenty of dissonance and experimentation found throughout the record, like on “Walk Up” or the oddly sweet “Motorbike”. The album reaches a climax on the 12 minute slowburn “The Magician”, which opens sweetly strum acoustic guitars and harmonicas, with the track slowly falling apart towards the end. While I’m incredibly sad to Black Midi taking a long-term break at a minimum, if Geordie Greep (or other band members) put out music of this caliber, I think I will manage okay.\n\nKey Tracks: The Magician, Terra, Blues"

Vampire Weekend - Only God Was Above Us\nOne of the most influential (if not most influential) indie rock band of the 2000s are back with my personal favorite record since their debut. While there were tracks on there previous album, “Father of the Bride” that I liked a lot, the 18 song tracklist led to a lot of throwaways that ultimately harmed the listening experience. On “Only God Was Above Us”, the project feels much more focused on creating an incredibly fun record that brings back the strengths of the group. The opening track “Ice Cream Piano” explodes with colorful sound to bring you headfirst into the album, before wonderfully transitioning into “Classical”, containing a battle between intricate melodic guitar riffs and siren-like slide guitar (which is a feature of much of this album). “Capricorn” is classic Vampire Weekend, with such an infectious and catchy vocal melody that makes you wonder how more artists don’t try to replicate it; one of my very favorite songs this past year. A thing that really stands out to me on this record is the degree of musicianship from this group. Not only is there is tremendous guitar throughout, but some truly fantastic piano, like on “Connect”. The siren guitar returns very suddenly on “Gen-X Cops” in a way that would jolt anyone awake (and maybe a good track to skip during a nap). The closing track “Hope” serves as a perfect bookend for the record, recreating many of the sounds heard throughout the record, before taking just slightly harder edge (at least for harder for Vampire Weekend). It is truly extraordinary how this band has been able to release so much amazing music in their career and can continue continue this excellence in their career. It is possible that “Only God Was Above Us” doesn’t reach the same heights as some of their earlier work, but a certain subset of fans (myself included) are likely to look back at this record as some of their best work.\n\nKey Tracks: Capricorn, Classical, Prep-School Gangsters, Gen-X Cops"

The duo of Mica Tenebaum and Matthew Lewin manage to strike this perfect balance of super catchy and accessible synth and dance pop, while adding plenty of experimentation and intricate arrangements to prevent things from getting stale. Beyond this, while each track stands well on it’s own, a lot of detail was put into how the album flows, making tracks be able to stand on their own while simultaneously rewarding listeners for investing in the project as a whole. For all the different sounds they introduce throughout the record, often my favorite part is the simple use of the keyboard, like on “Death and Romance”. That piano just sticks out over the other instruments and just love how it sounds. “Watching T.V.” at times is quite a beautiful emotional song, letting for just allowing a brief moment of space for Tenebaum’s vocals, before erupting into a wall of synths and crashing drums. Somehow, the record gets better as you move through, shifting tempos and sounds from track to track. If you want to dance, then look no further than the absolutely funky “Love is Everywhere” or the discoey “Cry for Me”. They even end the album brilliantly on “The Ballad of Matt & Mica” with a fun motif back to the excellent opening track. The real strength of this record isn’t just how absolutely fun it is, but it is the little details throughout the arrangements. I keep finding little things in the songs where I have to sick back and think “man, I really like what they added there”. On the final track, I was really charmed by the lyric “two Kids in a new town, baby. Is it my turn? Small-time fame. Bang-Bang and a happy ending”. If this album gets even half the attention it deserves, they are probably on their way to more than small-time fame.\n\nKey Tracks: Death and Romance, Watching T.V., Love Is Everywhere, Image"

While it may be true that life events made it harder for me to listen to music this past year, I would be lying if I didn’t say that part of the problem was that I just found myself coming back to this album over and over. As much as anything, this record felt like a companion when I found myself writing and coding a lot during the summer of 2024. For long time readers (if they exist…), they will recognize Cindy Lee (the drag alter-ego of Partick Flegel) from my 2020 list, with their excellent, incredibly distorted album lo-fi record What’s Tonight to Eternity. While it’s a beautiful record (Heavy Metal is a major standout for me), the heavy use of reverb and distortion makes the album a bit tough to approach if you aren’t a lo-fi music fan (and often I’m not). For the Cindy Lee discography, this is a much easier starting point.\nThe magic behind this record is hard to fully put my finger on. Flegel’s songwriting is squarely centered around 50s-60s nostalgia with softrock, soul, and doo-wop sounds found throughout. But the production makes the record feel like a time-capsule of a bygone era, or better yet, as Pitchfork magazine perfectly described it as “may be the greatest radio station you’ve ever come across“. There is no overarching theme or message behind the record, just a enourmous collection of songs that feel queued about by a DJ from a different time, one that brings me nothing but comfort. There are plenty of artists out their that wear their influences on their sleeves (including on this list!), but the thing that takes this record another level is the guitar playing. On the opening and title track, there is this great little rhythmic riff that serves both as great foundation for the song and as what is to come.\nOn tracks like “Kingdom Come” or “All I Want is You”, as Flegel dances up and down the neck of their guitar. Very quickly Flegel has become one my absolute favorite guitarists working in music right now. Beyond their virtuosic guitar ability, great use of distortion is used on many tracks, transitioning from sweet, melodic tones on “If You Hear Me Crying” before diving headfirst into screeching feedback. Such a cool moment. If you weren’t already impressed, just about every instrument (with a handful of small exceptions) and the production were also handled by Flegel, really making this their own masterpiece. The tracklist comes in at a whopping 32 tracks, with about 2 hours worth of music, but don’t let that intimidate you. There is so much to love about this record and truly hope you give it a good chance. Next time you have a mundane task ahead of you, throw Diamond Jubilee on. You may find yourself repeatedly stopping your task to take what is happening.\nAn important sidenote, this album is not available on traditional streaming platforms. It can be found on youtube, or via bandcamp.\n&lt;a href=\"https://cindylee.bandcamp.com/album/diamond-jubilee\"&gt;Diamond Jubilee by Cindy Lee&lt;/a&gt;\nKey Tracks: Kingdom Come, Diamond Jubilee, If You Hear Me Crying, Demon Bitch"

    "text": "Each year, in addition to my top albums, I make a top songs playlist as well (just in case people don’t want to listen to ~25 albums….). These playlists allow me to share songs that I love that aren’t necessarily in any of the top albums or only are released as singles.\nTypically the playlists consist of 100 songs, ranked from 1-100. In 2018, because I chose 40 albums rather than 10 or 25, I decided against a making top songs playlist. Additionally, for 2016, I did not make a top songs playlist as it was my first ever list. However, for both 2016 and 2018, I made 25 song playlist to showcase some of my favorite songs from those years. Lastly, I also made a playlist for my favorite song of the 2010s.\n\n2024\n\nKingdom Come - Cindy Lee**\nMy Golden Years - The Lemon Twigs\nToro - Remi Wolf\nDeath & Romance - Magdalena Bay\nRight Back to It - Waxahatchee & MJ Lenderman\nobsessed - Olivia Rodrigo\nGemini - Angélica Garcia\nEmpire Never Knows - Jessica Pratt\nThe Calm That Keeps You Awake - Knocked Loose\nRattlesnake - Rubblebucket\n\n\n**Kingdom Come can only be found on bandcamp or youtube.\n\n\n2023\n\nBlomi - Susanne Sunfor\nThe Clutch - Palehound\nBull Believer - Wednesday\nSwing (In A Dream) - Squid\nSoft Landing - Billy Woods and Kenny Segal\nFire the Editor - James Blake\nkisses - Slowdive\n2000 Miles - Jolie Holland\nMitski - I Don’t Like My Mind\nGarbage Pale Kids - JPEGMAFIA and Danny Brown\n\n\n\n\n2022\n\nThe Place Where He Inserted the Blade - Black Country, New Road\nHigh Hopes - Sweet Pill\nGold Chain Punk (whogonbeatmyass) - Soul Glo\nSugar/Tzu - Black Midi\nExpert In A Dying Field - The Beths\nAll The Good Times - Angel Olsen\nBasketball Shoes - Black Country, New Road\nGod Turn Me Into a Flower - Weyes Blood\nSummer Dream - Bonny Light Horseman\nSatan - Andy Shauf\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\nG.S.K - Squid\nBe Sweet - Japanese Breakfast\nMMMOOOAAAAAAYAYA - illuminati hotties\nRomeo - Jungle feat Bas\nOrange - Pinegrove\nPocket Square Mother Fucker\nHolocene - Zella Day feat Weyes Blood\nWrite A List of Things to Look Forward to - Courtney Barnett\nDelicious Things - Wolf Alice\nSecrets (Your Fire) - Magdalena Bay\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\nWill Call - Brass Tracks feat Elliott Skinner, Victoria Canal\nKyoto - Phoebe Bridgers\nHeld Down - Laura Marling\nHome - Caribou\nHeavy Metal - Cindy Lee\nThe Alarmist - Pinegrove\nSympathy for the Baby Boo - Deerhoof\nfree ppls - illuminati hotties\nLiving Room - Andy Shauf\nSelling Candy - Ohm (now called Fionom)\n\n\n\n\n2019\n\nHope - Alex G\nChance - Angel Olsen\nCentury - Big Thief\nDon’t Miss It - James Blake\nMorbid Stuff - PUP\nFaith - Bon Iver\nA Lot’s Gonna Change - Weyes Blood\nAn Empty Corner - Wilco\nReplaced - Big Thief\nTerlingua Girl - Lillie Mae\n\n\n\n\n2018\n\nBeach Life-In-Death - Car Seat Headrest\nMither - Bill Ryder-Jones\nRings - Pinegrove\nCity Looks Pretty - Courtney Barnett\nLemon Glow - Beach House\nGreat No One - The Beths\nAlmost Had to Start a Fight/In and Out of Patience - Parquet Courts\nTo Be - Fox Warren\nNevermine - Fourth Wanderers\n6 Summers - Anderson .Paak\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\nSugar for the Pill - Slowdive\nBet She Looks Like You - Nick Hakim\nMythological Beauty - Big Thief\nThinking of a Place - The War on Drugs\nDriver - John Andrews & The Yawns\nBaybee - Jay Som\nContinental Breakfast - Courtney Barnett, Kurt Vile\nSaturnz Barz - Gorillaz feat Popcaan\nShark Smile - Big Thief\nDie Young - Sylvan Esso\n\n\n\n\n2016\n\nThe Magician - Andy Shauf\nVincent - Car Seat Headrest\nHostage - Klangstof\nSister - Angel Olsen\nHidden Driver - LVL UP\nMartha Sways - Andy Shauf\nThe Devil and his Anarchist Surrealist Retinue - Deerhoof\nForeplay - Jalen Santoy\nIt’s Getting Late - Honeysuckle\nReal Love - Big Thief\n\n\n\n\n2010s\n\nHow Long Must I Wait - Dr. Dog\nI Love You, Honeybear - Father John Misty\nGimme All You Love - Alabama Shakes\nFeels Like We Only Go Backwards - Tame Impala\nThe Magician - Andy Shauf\nSugar of the Pill - Slowdive\nPedestrian at Best - Courtney Barnett\nShark Smile - Big Thief\nHope - Alex G\nVincent - Car Seat Headrest"
