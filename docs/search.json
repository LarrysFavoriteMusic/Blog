This list was probably one of my less experimental years of music, with a fantastic year for women in music (9 out 10 artists in the top 10 and 18 of the top 25 albums were female artists or bands led by women)."

    "text": "My First List\nFast forward several years. it was approaching finals week in my junior year at SUNY-ESF (go Mighty Oaks!), I unsurprisingly was finding myself in the library quite frequently either studying or working on final class projects. I was looking for something to help things bit more bearable. While procrastinating, I stumbled on to two different music related wesbites. The first was Album of the Year. Album of the year is social network/blog type website not dissimilar to sites like Rate Your Music. However, an important difference that also serves as a database for both reviews from music critics and users of the website. This serves as useful aggregator of what music people are interested in. Since occur in early December, it was also “list season”; where major publications release their lists for the top albums of the year. Album of the Year also compiles this information with point totals to provide a consensus album of the year. I found this whole process incredibly fascinating and a lot of fun, particularly when an album you like is seeing a lot of love.\nThe second outlet is from an NPR podcast that I had already been regularly listening to for about year, All Songs Considered. This is a wonderful music podcast hosted by Bob Boilen (the same person who created Tiny Desk Concerts) and Robin Hilton. They had just released a pod discussing listener picks for the best albums of the year. For whatever reason, I found (and still find this…) fascinating. This got me thinking about what my favorite albums of the past year were and inspired me to make my own list. I then wrote down some 30 albums, and listened to each one during finals week and picked my 10 favorites. This was the beginning of a yearly tradition at the end of the year where I listen to a barrage of music to make my list.\n\n\nGoing Forward\nThis website has 3 major purpose:\n\nCompile all of my lists and playlists into one place for ease of access\nImprove coding and writing skills with a website/pseudoblog project\nMake it easier to share my favorite music with a potentially larger audience\n\nThis website is a major work in process. I’m still working out many bugs in the website, filling out its contents, and just making things look pretty. I will be constantly be editing things as there will no doubt be typos everywhere. I’m also not particularly adept of this style of writing so this a learning experience for me. I absolutely would love to hear any suggestions from people on what else I should do for this website. I’m thinking about a blog as well but not sure what exactly to blog about. Stay tuned!"

The albums that are on this list still find their way into my listening queues on fairly regular basis. I also didn’t make a top songs playlist to accompany the album list so I’ll name a handful tracks that remain favorites to me, but tracks that really stand out to me from this year include:\nPlus tons of other songs, some of which I feature in this list.

But as far as I’m concerned, Lucy’s biggest strength is her soothing voice, which enhances her words. “Map on the Wall” serves as a nice slow burn track, helping to fill out the rest of the album.

This record is filled with lush strings and subtle beats, topped off with Ry Cuming’s gentle vocals. In particular, “Howling” has this simple little bit and yet does so much to make the song an earworm. “Berlin” remains a super hit for this artist (179 million streams on spotify) and probably the best vocal performance on the record as Ry’s voice matches the guitar note for note in the background. A true highlight is the gorgeous “Beacon” led by the an orchestral string section the builds with guitars and percussion in the background. This album serves as a perfect late-night companion, and one that likely will find myself spending time with in the future.\n\nKey Tracks: Beacon, Howling"

The dutch trio melds together electronic and indie pop together to create dreamy landscape, filled with songs with slow-burns. This album opens strongly with the meloncholy instrumental track “Doolhof” with ringing guitars and plenty of bass, setting the scene for the rest of the album. “Hostage” is this amazing slow-burn track starting off as a modest alt-pop with subtle guitar and electronic drum kit before evolving into an expansive dream-pop climax. “Island” perfectly closes out the record with another slow build up, starting with a catchy beat and vocal melody while constantly building on the current song. Before you know it, you find yourself surrounded by synths and echoing guitars. This album remains a classic for me, and honestly a pretty cool find for this just being my first official list.\n\nKey Tracks: Hostage, Island"

This album follows the absolutely amazing “Burn Your Fire For No Witness”, which by in large was Angel Olsen’s breakout hit, and really outdoes herself. The album starts off with this incredible “Intern”, containing nothing but a synth and Angel’s iconic voice, before transitioning into the almost rockabilly “Never Mine”. If this album really demonstrates anything, its Angel’s ability to craft a well paced tracklist, with the front end filled with singles (including the lead single “Shut Up Kiss Me”), with the back end containing more B-side tracks like the dreamy “Those Were the Days”. The track “Sister” remains as one Angel’s best songs, with the front half containing a relaxed ballot that Fleetwood Mac would have been proud of, before building to a soaring guitar solo. This was a statement from Angel, not only in that she has the ability to change up her sound, but that she was going to be one of the most consistent songwriters in music.\n\nKey Tracks: Sister, Never Be Mine, Shut Up Kiss Me"

That being said, this album is criminally underrated in the Wilco catalog. This album only came a year after the well received “Star Wars” (an album title that was meant stir up a lawsuit that never materialized), containing tons of fun songs with fuzzy guitars, loose arrangements, and lackadaisical vocals from Jeff Tweedy. “Schmilco” follows a completely opposite formula, with tight arrangements, a minimalist approached, and some of Jeff’s most introspective lyrics to date. The album opens with “The Normal American Kids”, only featuring an acoustic guitar with lead electric flourishes and Jeff’s voice, exploring his frustration as an and drug use as an adolescent. “If I was Ever a Child” is reminiscent of the alt-country ascetic of “Being There”. “Locator” is an experimentation into a minimalist noise rock song, giving the album some sonic range. I love the very simple guitar/piano melody and almost whispered vocals on “Shrug and Destroy” that just set this wonderful hushed mood. Anything Wilco releases will immediately be compared to there legendary works from the late 1990s into the 2000s, which I think does a disservice to the albums individually. Turns out, even if a record isn’t a band’s best work, if you are as talented as Wilco, its still going to be pretty damn good.\n\nKey Tracks: If I Ever Was A Child, Locator, Shrug and Destroy"

Henson gained a cult following on is fantastic debut “Dear”, that contained largely guitar only tracks like “You Don’t Know How Lucky You Are”. Here, Henson opts for more piano driven tracks, bulstered by orchestral sections. Keaton Henson writes a truly beautiful song that can be difficult to get through. Much of the lyrical content is centered around a particularly painful break up and missing this person. The “Pugilist” starts similar to tracks on “Dear” before growing into the much larger sound that you come to expect from the rest of the album On “Alright” Henson talks about how he’s managing without this person, or lamenting losing this person on the closing track “How Could I Have Known”, that swells into emotional orchestral finale. This album is filled a lot of pain, but for those who can stand it, or those who just want bawl their eyes out, there is a lot of beauty to be found.\n\nKey Tracks: Holy Lover, Alright, I Should Have Known"

Every time I listen to “You and I” and can’t help hum along to the guitar part. She really shows off her guitar chops on “Memory Street”, ripping her way through a blues solo. The true stand out is the title track “Emotions and Math” with yet another catchy little riff played on the low E string and probably Margaret’s best vocal performance on the entire album. The simple studio approach to this album really allows the song writing stand on its own and I think is a real strength. A really impressive debut record from Margaret Glaspy.\n\nKey Tracks: Emotions and Math, You and I, Memory Street"

I don’t mean in the sense of him being sonically adventurous or genre breaking but just huge is albums, with Teens of Denial being his masterpiece. For starters, this album contains not 1 but 2 ~10 minute ballads on the B-side of the record which I think really captures how hard Will was swinging for the fences. A major theme throughout the record is teenage agnst and the drug and alcohol use that often pairs with it. The album opens strong with punchy “Fill in the Blank” a track that could have been written by the Ramones before easy into the albums centerpiece “Vincent”. Vincent is such insane song, starting with just a ringing guitar, building tension and slowly loses control in chaotic climax. Immediately after, the album transitions in the heavy power chords on “Destroyed by Hippie Powers” which just kicks absolute ass. Another highlight is the the anthem against drunk driving “Drunk Drivers/Killer Whales” (though I never figured out what the killer whale is in reference to…). The Ballad of Costa Concorida is the second of the two ballads on the back end of the album that starts slow (with an interesting reference to Didos “White Flag”) before erupting into a grand finale. The ambition on this record is honestly a breath of fresh air and reminder that there is still life within the genre of rock.\n\nKey Tracks: Vincent, Drunk Drivers/Killer Whales, The Ballad of the Costa Concodria"

Andy Shauf is someone I listened to obsessively throughout college (so much so I was seriously considering driving to Toronto from Eastern NY to see him play the day before Thanksgiving), and was because of this album. The album contains incredibly lush arrangements including clarinets and strings, with every instrument (excluding the strings) being played by Shauf himself, allowing Andy to control every detail of the record. “The Party” is a concept album based around events at house party (but not necessarily during the same night). Andy Shauf’s soft voice serves as a perfect narrator to follow different individuals and exploring their thoughts or feelings. Feelings that people are to familiar like being jealous of how out going someone is (Eyes of Them All) or drunkenly embarrassing yourself (Twist Your Ankle). The album also follows two characters, Sherrie and her love interest Jeremy. “Early to the Party” follows Sherry, arriving awkwardly early to a party, with Andy perfectly captures the uncomfortable feelings behind this. On one of my favorite tracks on the album “To You”, Sherry uncomfortably attempts to share her feelings to Jeremy only to for her to back down. The Party even has real drama, with the track “Alexander All Alone”, Alexander collapses dead outside while smoking a cigarette (and oddly enough increases the body count on Andy Shauf records to 4). The album of closes perfectly, with “Martha Sways” as the narrator slows dances with Martha at the end of the party that reminds him of someone else, with lush strings bringing him (and the listener) into a daydream. The song closes with the lines “Martha Spins, and I catch her hand. She smiles and laughs, bringing me back” snapping us out of the daydream. It one of my very favorite music moments. I cannot express how much I love this album and as such, I chose it as my album of the decade for the 2010s.\n\nKey Tracks: The Magician, To You, Martha Sways, Early to the Party"

At this point, Kendrick has really solidified himself as one the greats in Hip Hop, and this album contains so much of that confidence on tracks like”DNA”. My absolute favorite is the closing track “Duckworth”, detailing the crazy coincidence of his father Duckworth meeting Top Dawg many years prior to Kendrick signing for his label.\n\nKey Tracks: Duckworth, DNA, Humble"

The track “Baby” has one of the vibest introductions to it, and I’m in love with the guitar tones throughout. “Bus Song” was a breakout hit for Jay Som, containing bright lyrics and horn section (and I so here for the positivity towards public transportation). The album closes strongly with the woozy “For Light”, with distorted vocals and a bright guitar towards end of the track.

This album is just a masterclass it what makes dream pop so amazing, with bright melodic guitars, hushed and reverbed vocals, and an overall melancholy feeling behind it all. The album opens wonderfully with “Slomo” that have the two vocalists intertwining their voices as the ringing guitar envelopes them. “Star Roving” is a perfect track to zip down the highway to at night with the driving percussion and fuzzy guitars. But the absolute highlight is the masterpiece “Sugar For the Pill”. The ringing guitar melody that plays at the start and throughout the track is guaranteed to stick in your head, as the song exhibits cascading guitars before building to the incredibly climax towards the end of the song. The album closes with the beautiful piano ballad on “Falling Ashes”, a nice contrast to the rest of the album. This a perfect soundtrack to any late night driving or staying up late for school or work. It’s amazing that a band can take such a long hiatus only to create arguably their best work.

On many occasions, Feist inverts a typical song structure where the quietest parts are reserved for the chorus. Her use of dynamics make the album exciting as it can go from loud to quite to loud again at any moment. On “I Wish I Didn’t Miss You”, the guitar is strummed almost percussively that along with vocal effects, give the track a bit of a bite. There is tons of great guitar work throughout the album like on tracks like “I’m Not Running Away” and the title tracks. Perhaps the coolest moment on the album is the transition of “Any Party” into “A Man is Not His Song”, which then closes with a brief moment of metal in the background. Feist has produced a lot of really great music, but this album takes the cake.

The guitars come in full force towards the end of the track which just makes the song hit that much harder.”I Bet She Looks Like You” has this great ringing electric guitar part that evolves into a deliberately messy guitar solo that made it one of my favorite songs of the year. “Cuffed” has a great drum beat to it that makes the track feel almost like a jam, and has this really cool slowdown towards the end of track. The B-side of the record, Nick leans more into the production like on tracks “Miss Chew” and “The Want”, filled with layered harmonies and wacky vocal effects. The production on this record is just top notch and it gives so much personality to it, and you’d be hard pressed to find albums that do it better.\n\nKey Tracks: I Bet She Looks Like You, Cuffed, Green Twins, Miss Chew"

    "text": "1. Big Thief: Capacity\nThe album that made me fall in love with Big Thief. This band has become so important in my life and few artists are as consistent of songwriters as Adrianne Lenker (or efficient in their output). “Capacity” came dropped only a year after the incredibly well received debut album “Masterpiece” and solidified them as one of the best acts in indie rock. There is just so much incredibly songwriting and band arrangements throughout the track list, and some of Adiranne’s best lyrical work. “Pretty Things” opens the album with this a mysterious acoustic part exploring complicated feelings in femininity and masculinity during sex. Immediately following is truly wonderful “Shark Smile” that starts off with tumultuously before simply to a driving rhythm guitar part. The song details two young lovers right up until a car crash that kills just one. There is this amazing little guitar solo that Buck Meek does on this track that is so simple and yet is exactly what the song calls for (a playing style the Buck is particularly adept at). “Mythological Beauty” is another stunning song where Adrianne sings about her mother who had her a very young age, detailing her childhood including being rushed to the hospital while her mother held in arms covering her bloodied head with a rag. “Haley” contains a really cool guitar part, showing off Adiranne’s great guitar skills (and a song I have yet to figure out how to play). The emotional climax is on the breathtaking track “Mary”, a piano ballad that is just a true emotional gut punch and the standout for a lot of fans of this album. Big Thief has gone on to put out more truly incredible records, but somehow I always find myself coming back to this one.\n\nKey Tracks: Shark Smile, Mythological Beauty, Mary, Haley"

    "text": "This was a very significant year of change for me. I graduated from SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry in May 2018, and started my Ph.D in atmospheric sciences at the University of Albany a couple of weeks later. It seems fitting this was the year I decided switch up the format for the album of the list. If there was one year I could pick to redo a list for, it’s probably this one. I decided on choosing 40 albums rather than 10 or 25 as there was just a ton of albums I really liked that year that I wanted to represent in some way. Look back now, I was right; there are just a ton of albums that I enjoy that year. However, 40 was probably a few too many as there are a handful of albums that haven’t aged well for me. I would probably reshuffle the Top 10 pretty significantly as well. Albums like Low’s hauntingly beautiful and experimental “Double Negative” or Beach House’s subperb “7” probably deserve to be higher up on this list, while albums like Lucy Dacus’s “Historian” or the fun hot mess that is Anderson.Paak’s “Oxnard” probably should be lower on the list. Most regrettably, Pinegrove’s “Skylight” is suspiciously missing from this list, which I still cannot believe I didn’t include. Still, 2018 had a lot of music I really loved, and I often associate with graduation. It’s hard not to look back at this list with nostalgia."

This trio includes Amelia Meath of Slyvan Esso, Molly Sarlé, and Alexandra Sauser-Monnig of Daughter of the Swords, all who attended Bennington College together. Together, they produce a master class in minimalistic traditional and indie folk, opting for nothing more than simple acoustic guitar parts and their amazing vocal harmonies. Tracks like “Whale Song” and “Bright Morning Stars” use space perfectly to really necessitate their siren like vocal harmonies. The incredibly cozy and comforting, “Slow Wake Up Sunday Morning” is true highlight from this record, that is only made better in the context of the full album."

But on “WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO”, Billie and her brother create this gloomy bedroom pop that didn’t really sound like anything else in popular music at the time. It’s biggest strength is where other pop music tends to ignore; subtlety. She has bangers like “bad guy”, but without the need of big beats or crazy vocal runs. “bury a friend” is an especially cool song. I really enjoy the vocal harmonies that come in and out throughout the song. It makes the song so thrilling. The album closes with this neat idea with Billie bringing back parts of various songs to act as a summary for the whole record. Super promising debut, especially for someone so young.\n\n\nKey Track: bury a friend, ilomilo"

It’d be wrong not to mention the dark “Boy Will Be Boys” confronting the bizarre permission structure that boys are allowed to have towards girls and women. Really interesting juxtapositions of bright music and dark underlying themes throughout the record.\n\n\nKey Tracks Old Man, Tricks"

Highlights include “Milieux”, starting off somewhat hollow in sound before the guitars come in full force, or “Trapped on A Planet” that borders on screamo. This isn’t an album I listen to all that often, but if I want something like and crazy, this record always comes to mind.\n\n\nKey Tracks Milieux, Trapped on a Planet"

Nilüfer Yanya managed to make a really cool alternative pop record filled with cool interludes, plucky guitars, and messy vocals that are just perfect for the sound of the entire. It’s a pretty long record at that, with 17 tracks and coming in at 53 minutes, but never overstaying its welcome. “In Your Head” is has the big sound with these great fuzzy guitars to it and a great vocal performance from Nilüfer. The guitar work on “Paralyzed” is fantastic alternating between the plucky melodic lead guitar and fuzzy rhythm guitar.”Safety Net” is another highlight, a more reserved pop track with a catchy chorus. A great alternative pop record that doesn’t quite like anything else released in 2019.\n\n\nKey Tracks: In Your Head, Safety Net"

Its a weird thing to say, but I just like the way Little Simz says words, not just her flow and cadence, but just her speaking voice. The album has beats for days, like on the jazz rap “Offence” in which she goes off on any of her haters or doubters, or the crazy flow she finds on “Wounds” or “Venom”. “Pressure”, Little Simz goes after the privileged classes while also trying to reach those same heights. My favorite hip record of 2019.\n\n\nKey Tracks: Offence, Pressure"

Every year, there is a straight ahead indie rock album that I fall in love with, and this was the one for 2019. There are no special tricks here, just honest to god good indie-rock songwriting without needing to hide behind production. There are some many times that Stef starts the song off more reserved before opening into these garage rock anthems and I love it every time. “Method Man” just straight up kicks ass, opening confidently before descending into chaos with crazy drums and tons of feedback on her guitars. “Jumpin’ Jack” is a fun track that opens as almost a rockabiliy kind track before transitioning back to more garage rock. This album doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but man there is so much to love here.\n\n\nKey Tracks: Method Man, Jumpin’ Jack"

But I’d argue his vocal performances are what makes this album shine, like on tracks like “Manifest”. “Sisyphus” is a fantastic opener to the record, with a patented whistling melody and a interestingly busy bass line that gives the song so much life. “Bloodless” has chilling refrains of “bloodless for now” and “history forgets the moderates”, implying the potential for violent conflict in the not distant future. This is a really fantastic album. The only question is, is this only is finest work yet.\n\n\nKey Tracks: Sisyphus, Manifest"

Anderson has the amazing ability to take big ideas and combine them into all kinds of classic songs, but sometimes this ambition gets the best of him, with Oxnard and to lesser extent, Malibu, having somewhat messing endings. On Ventura, he moves past that, with a collection of more funk and disco type tracks. The album starts off great with “Come Home”, that starts with this silky smooth drum beat and finishes of with a amazing Andre 3000 feature. The real highlight on record is “Winner Circle”, starting off as this Jazz rap type track, before Anderson just drops the hammer on his flow on the back of the track (such a cool moment). This record is the most focused work in Anderson Paak’s career so far, and a great way to finish the trilogy.\n\n\nKey Tracks: Winners Circle, Come Home"

But the album doesn’t stay that way, with Lillie creating just lovely traditional country and blue grass songs like on “Didn’t I” and “I Came for the Band (For Show)”, prominently displaying her great fiddle playing. The album emotional climax is the same as it started, with the show stopping “Terlingua Girl”, starting of as simple country before erupting into huge guitars and drums. This is definitely my favorite country album in recent memory, and any time I hear someone say that no one makes good country like the old days, I immediately point them to Lillie Mae.\n\n\nKey Tracks: Terlingua Girl, You’ve Got Other Girls for That, A Golden Year"

We had been hearing stuff on the news about COVID, but didn’t think things would get too bad. When I arrive at work, i find out that if I had shown up a day later, they weren’t going to let me in the building. A few days later, we get the “go home for 2 weeks” instruction. Another week later I packed my car back to go home, and not leave really leave home for a long time. To make things worse, the presidential election became an utter shit show, with election “night” stretching into election week in which I slept very little. It wasn’t all bad news. I managed to pass my written exam, a major milestone in my journey to recieving my PhD.\nWith all this in the background, this made for an odd year of music for me. I find that this list is a more melancholy or experimental than other years, which probably matches how I felt at the time.

    "text": "10. Cindy Lee: What’s Tonight to Eternity\nThe album just absolutely fascinates me. On it’s base, many of the songs are pretty on face value. Yet, you have the lo-fi production surrounding the songs, making for a truly eerie listening experience. The halloween-esq “I Want You To Suffer” begins with this almost Scooby Doo vibe to it before descending into pure distortion and feed back that is honestly quite unsettling, before coming back into focus. The following track has this 1940s song quality to it, but feels like it’s being played on a broker radio playing in another room. The album closes on it’s best track, “Heavy Metal”, sharing a similar oldies song style to it, but has this infectious guitar riff, a swelling string section, and a sweet choir of vocals, ending an album that at times can be quite abrasive, on a beautiful note."

Compared to his fantastic debut “Green Twins” this record often feels that it’s in no rush, with song containing tempos that almost feel like they purposely drag. Compared to previous works that had Nick’s vocals under tons of reverb, his voice feels more out in front with beautiful arrangements that compliment this so nicely. My favorite song on the record “Gods Dirty Work” has this amazing contrast between a strummed acoustic and a silky smooth lead guitar that just play off each other in way that I’m just in love with. The peaceful “Whoo” with a subtle flute notes towards the end, providing a perfect way to close this album. A great companion for relaxing evening.\n\nKey Tracks: Gods Dirty Work, Qadir, Whoo"

There is plethora of this ringing, and at times, grating guitar that just breathe so much life into these tracks. I love the technically proficient and yet deliberately off beat screeching guitar on “Sympathy for the Baby Boo” or the climbing scales in “Farewell Symphony” that descend into pure chaos in the second half of the record. “O Ye Saddle Babes” stands out has this fun, funky song, that almost feels dancable. The album ends with this lovely piano instrumental that almost feels like a palate cleanser at the end of wonderful but truly bizarre experience. Perhaps the only thing more chaotic then the sounds on this album is the incomprehensible track names.\n\nKey Tracks: Sympathy for the Baby Boo, “Farewell” Symphony, O Ye Saddle Babes"

The album starts of strong with “Dotted Line” containing fantastic harmonies and a fantastic guitar riff that always gets stuck in my head. “The Alarmist” some their lead singer Evan Stephens Hall’s absolutely best song writing tied to one of his best vocal performances for the band, particularly on the bridge. “Moment” almost feels like a jam session on the back end of the track. The album also contains the prophetic “Endless” that Pinegrove described at one of their live shows as an “accidental pandemic song”.

It was released very suddenly in late September, as we approached the first dark winter of COVID for the U.S. and we were in the middle of the clusterfuck that was the 2020 presidential election. In short, things were scary and tense. The world needed (or at least I believe the world needed) this record. “Shore” feels like a sister album to the fantastic (and slightly underrated if you ask me) “Crack Up”. However, rather than the grandiose songwriting that can make the approaching the project a bit daunting, on “Shore” the Fleet Foxes simplified things to allow songs to work better on their own, and to wonderful effect. This is just this bright optimism on songs like “Sunblind” that filled me with comfort. “Featherweight” is a standout track on the record, open with plucky acoustic guitar and an almost sea-faring vibe to it. As all Fleet Foxes albums, their are layered harmonies, folk acoustics that border on medieval aesthetics , and the undeniably melodic lead vocals from Robin Pecknold. I’m not sure I’ve ever had an album that came at such a perfect time in my life more than this and it’s hard not to come back to this album with the exact same feeling.\n\nKey Tracks: Sunblind, Featherweight, Can I Believe You"

Sarah Tudzin of illuminati hotties released a really fun power pop/indie rock record in 2018, so I was interested to find out that this project was releasing a new album. However, this is no typical follow record, really considered more of a mixtape. At its core, this album is a punk album, filled with great production and biting lyrics. “Freed Ppls” is this almost speed metal like track that hits hard and collapses into chaos. “Content//Bedtime” is the describes the all too real feeling of a having a day being filled with just work then bed (probably a little to well…). Another striking thing about this record is it’s brevity, coming in at a very quick 23 minutes with only 1 song lasting longer than 2 and half minutes. Despite much of the album being recorded before the pandemic, the lyrics on “Free Dumb” reading “there was no love lost until you demand that I was non-essential” hits much harder in the context of 2020. And yet, it feels as if you get a full album experience. The closing track is a nice way to close out feelings of anger and anxiety, with Sarah thinking of things about loved ones that make her happy. This mixtape may not be the one we were supposed to wait for, but it’s hard to deny that something truly special was made here.\n\nKey Tracks: Free Ppls, Content/Bedtime, Melatonezone, Superiority Complex (Big Noise)"

Here on the “Neon Skyline” Andy steps back the lush arrangements just a bit to allow for the story to take center stage, following a guy hearing about his ex-girlfriend returning to his hometown, only to run into her at while out at the bar, and unsuccessfully trying to make his move. This album is only about 34 minutes, and yet there is so much characterization throughout, whether it’s talking about reincarnation on “Dust Kids” or on the lounge-room like “Living Room” where a mother laments her acting like her father toward her own kid. Andy Shauf’s voice serves as a perfect narrator, providing a pleasant tone that doesn’t distract the story telling throughout the song. I’m just not aware of other artists that can capture the intimacy of relate able situations quite like Andy. The album closes perfectly with “Changer”, where the protagonist and his ex are just catching up talking about how the met and what brought them back to town, enveloped with a sweet but simple guitar part and Andy’s distinct clarinets. You truly feel like you have lived through this experience, and all in just 34 minutes.\n\nKey Tracks: Living Room, Changer, Try Again, The Neon Skyline"

I also am not sure this would be my album of the year if it was released on a different. But context matters so much when making these lists, and it was an obvious choice for the top spot in 2020. This just struck a perfect emotional chord with me. There is also just a truly amazing number of amazing songs. “Kyoto” is this fun ( well at least sonically) song with a memorable trumpet part to the track and chorus that’s just begging you to scream-sing along. “Saviors Complex” has this incredible melody that I can’t help but hum along with every time it comes on. “ICU” has the slow burn to it that builds to the amazing final chorus and has the great lyric ’I hate your mom, I hate when she opens her mouth. It’s amazing to me how much you can say when you don’t know what your talking about” The albums ends with the truly cathartic finale on “I Know the End”, ending with Phoebe just screaming, which was just such a relateable feeling at the time. The album inevitably launched Phoebe into stardom, and it’s just such a cool thing to see, as this is an artist I had heard of since college, before her full-length debut. All in all, this album may not be all time favorite number 1 album of a year, but it’s one of the most important number 1 albums on all of the lists I’ve made.\n\nKey Tracks: Kyoto, ICU, Garden Song, Savior Complex"

I spent much of my summer at the summit of Whiteface Mountain, collecting cloud water and aerosol data for my eventual dissertation and was truly horrified by how hazy so many of the days were, despite being 100s-1000s of miles away from the actual fires. During the fall, I had the great pleasure of moving to Boulder, Colorado, for a few months, which was a welcome change from being stranded in my apartment.\nThis list really highlights how much women kicked ass in the music industry in 2021, with 9 out of the top 10 albums and 18 of the top 25 albums were from female artists or female led bands. It was also a list that was considerably cheery than its 2020 counterpart which has to be tied to my improved mood throughout 2021. The only critique of this list I probably would have is a general lack of folk/acoustic/singer songwriter and more experiemental type music. Even so, this album was a perfect companion for a year that represented both healing and tragedy."

The opening track “Content” is just a perfect way to start the special, with simple drum kit and great little synth lines. The special starts off reasonably bright, with razor sharp commentary, but devolved pretty quickly as Bo’s mental health clearly deteriorates right before your eyes. Frankly, there are times that this special is pretty hard to watch (the scene where he’s trying to film a scene and keeps messing the lines up and freaking out makes my stomach turn every time). “That Funny Feeling” is truly a masterpiece that contains raw emotion that artists not trying to be funny could only dream of.

The album also doesn’t overstay its welcome, only running at about 36 minutes, as this project could have easily become overbloated. “Blast Off” is great way to close the album, feeling like a great summary for the project as a whole. Oh and how can I forget the Thundercat cameos throughout the record that are just so damn funny. I guess I shouldn’t be surprised that two hit machines were able to make an album full of hits. But there something more here; the project of Silk Sonic is distinct from either of their previous work and seems to have brought the best out of both artists.\n\nKey Tracks: Smoking Out The Window, Leave The Door Open"

    "text": "12. Crumb: Ice Melt\nThis album intrigues me to no end. I frankly struggle to define the exact sound of this group beyond some form of indie psychedelic rock. Doesn’t matter too much though, because they managed to create a really great album. Each track is shrouded in mystery, with creative production techniques and ample use of reverb. There many instances that almost feel like a jam, like on the track “BNR”, the starts off slow and simple before erupting into a percussion heavy psychedelic bop. “Balloons” is so energetic, with this cascading synth line ringing throughout the track, led by almost detached vocal parts. While the production choices give this album a lot it’s personality, the drummer is the major standout performer here, setting the tone and energy for each and every track. This an incredibly fun but difficult album to define. However, this undefinable quality of the record may be its greatest strength.\n\nKey Tracks: BNR, Trophy"

On their previous record “Future Teenage Cave Artists”, Deerhoof created this raw noise rock album containing tons of disonate guitar work. On “Actually, You Can”, they take a considerably more melodic approach, completely driving by incredibly bright guitar lines. I’m honestly blow away by some the scale runs that are done on this album like on the wonderful “Scarcity is Manufactured” (a great song title) or my personal favorite track “Be Unbarred, O Ye Gates of Hell”. In addition to the amazing guitar work, I love the tone of the snare drum on many of these tracks, which has the bright pop to it that just adds so much to these track. Really not too much more you can say about this album beyond Deerhoof continues to make interesting and engaging music with stellar guitar parts.

    "text": "10. Lucy Dacus: Home Video\nIf Lucy Dacus’s “Historian” was about branching out to a bigger sound, “Home Video” was about perfecting her lyrical style. The record starts off strong with its best song “Hot & Heavy” detailing Lucy helping a love interest find themselves only for the outgrow Lucy, with lines like “You let me in your world until you had enough”. The track also contains a couple of little slow downs that add a something extra to the song. This album is full of emotional gut punches and sad stories that can bring just about anybody to tears, like on the track “Thumbs”, as Lucy accompanies her friend while meeting her estranged father. The line “I love your eyes, and he has them. But you have his”, before imaging popping the fathers eyes right out of his head. Chilling stuff really. “Please Stay” is another heartbreaker, with Lucy begging a presumably suicidal loved one to stay around by any means necessary, whether it be quitting their job, going back to school, or even never talking to Lucy again. “Triple Dog Dare” serves a perfect finale for the record, as Lucy imagines running away with someone. Lucy has always a had great ability to write wonderful lyrics, but this her best effort yet, even if at times is a little bit difficult to get through. As someone who has listened to her since her debut record “No Burden”, its been really amazing to see her develop into the gifted lyricist she is today.\n\nKey Tracks: Hot & Heavy, Please Stay, Triple Dog Dare"

To be honest, I was a little bit luke warm on this album when I first heard and really didn’t understand why the online music community was losing its mind over it. But I kept coming back to it, and it got better with ever listen. I think what kept me around was “Secrets”, which has this unbelievably catchy hook towards the beginning. The album is so much more than just a collection of single though, as song flow perfectly into one another. I really love the transition from “Secrets” in the the video game soundtrack-esque “You Lose”. The arrangements throughout the songs are also complex as they are compelling, with intricate basslines, melodic synths and guitars, and the fun vocals from Mica Tenenbaum. The album just hits you over the head with head bopping track after track without a weak one in the bunch. If I had made my list any later in 2021, this album probably would have climbed even higher in the rankings. It’s also probably the album I come back to the most from 2021. If your looking for an incredibly fun synth-pop record, look no futher.\n\nKey Tracks: Secrets, You Lose, Something for 2"

Clairo: Sling\nAs mentioned earlier, I struggled a bit in 2021 to find a lot of acoustic or singer songwriter albums that I connected with, but I managed to find one from a fairly unlikely source in Clairo. Clario broke onto the scene with bedroom pop tracks like “Pretty Girls” and “Sofia” (which have have 300+ and 500+ million streams on Spotify, which was something I did not expect). On “Sling” she creates these really lovely soft rock and folk tracks. I really enjoy the instrumentation on the album, with a standup piano, a super smooth tone on the lead guitar, and occasional cameos from flutes and clarinets. This combination produces an incredibly warm and cozy sound. The album opens with my favorite track “Bambi”, serving a perfect introduction with delicate harmonies and clarinets and flutes on full display. “Amoeba” is probably the most energetic the album becomes with a lead guitar part that absolutely love. The album even has an a great instrumental on Joanie, starting off with this cute little piano riff before evolving into a bit of a jam session. While I didn’t perhaps get the quantity of acoustic albums I was looking for, this album is certainty quality.\n\nKey Tracks: Bambi, Amoeba, Harbor"

So many the tracks are littered with this electronic keyboard flourishes, driving beats, and low note guitar parts that create a really unique sound.

On “Daddy’s Home” she pays homage to 70s music and is related to her father coming home from prison (though no mention of it on the album). I love the soul and funk influences that are ever-present throughout the record. One thing that I have missed on some of St Vincent’s more recent work is guitar playing, as she probably one of the most talented guitarist in popular music. On “Daddy’s Home”, her playing plays a considerably more prominent role. “Down” is the fun little pop single with a great chorus and an absolute gem of a guitar solo on the bridge. The title track has this great little wavy sound on the guitar solo. There is also this great call and response with her backup vocalists that contribute a lot of playfulness to the tracks. I can’t be surprised at this point that St. Vincent has put out yet another terrific album. However, it probably one of my favorites in her whole catalog.\n\nKey Tracks: Down, Daddy’s Home, My Baby Wants a Baby"

Illuminati Hotties is another artist who released an album 2 years in a row that made the top 10 list, after the whirlwind of her previous record and its another indie rock gem. It does seem to be that Sarah Tudzin under happier circumstances as this album is much brighter than her last years effort, filled to the brim 90s and 2000s rock influences. For example, she opens with the sugar sweet “Pool Hopping”, an energetic power pop anthem with fun lyrics that is a must for any summer playlists. Or on\n“Knead” a garage rock banger that feels like you would hear in a soundtrack to a movie about college in the 2000s. Sarah’s vocal delivery on many of the songs help to keep this loose as well, with her almost sounding bratty at times, which just works perfectly for the tracklist. However, she still shows signs of her more experimental/noise rock side with my favorite track (and I hope I spelled this correctly) “MMMOOOAAAAAYAYA”, finding a perfect mix between crazy chords progressions and face melting power chords (especially towards the back of the record). In a year of really strong indie rock, this album stands out and a great reminder that there is still tons to love in the genre.\n\nKey Tracks: MMMOOOAAAAAYAYA, Pool Hooping, Knead"

This is just a wonderful collection of damn good soul songs, topped off with the just undeniable talent of Yola. The opening track “Barely Alive” is my also my favorite, showing off Yola’s great ability to belt and the catchy refrain “And we try to get by, and we strive, but we’re barely alive”. It transitions into this almost disco like track on “Dancing Away In Tears” that makes you want to do the same. “If I Had To Do It All Again” is another highlight, starting off small, slowly building tension before she is joined by strings, backup vocals, and a great lead guitar, which is just such a cool moment. “Now You’re Here” is this sweet love song that is just pure positive vibes that makes me sway every time. There isn’t a particularly large variety in the sound for the whole record, but the pacing of the songs and the just incredibly strong songwriting and backing band more than makes up for it. If you’re looking for an album to put you a great mood, look no further.\n\nKey Tracks: Barely Alive, Now You’re Here, If I Had To Do It All Again"

There is so much ambition throughout the entire project and it pretty much always comes off for them. A critical component of this band (and most post-punk bands really) is the iconic vocals from Ollie Judge, which at times feel untethered. The album opens strong, with my song of the year “GSK”. It baffles how much ground they are able to cover in just over 3 minutes, starting off reserved before transitioning into noise rock, and then quickly into a little jazz section driven by some tremendous trumpet. “Narrator” is an absolute ride, starting off with a lively and is somewhat reminiscent to the Talking Heads, before descending into chaos, complete with narration (maybe intentional?). “2010” is another example of this band transition back and forth between almost jazz like song structures and then noise rock. This process keeps you on the edge of your seat, as the album could go off at any point. “Global Groove” is such a cool song to me, with out in front percussion and rising horn section supporting the almost scary vocal section. The album closes strongly with “Pamphlets”, serving a perfect summary of the entire album. In a year I was looking for more experimental work, this album was an absolute breath of fresh air. An essential album for any post-punk fans out there.\n\nKey Tracks: G.S.K, Narrator, 2010, Global Groove"

Michelle Zauner had managed to make a unique indie pop record with top-notch production (see tracks like “Road Head” or “Boyish”). She then went on to put out the amazing single Essentially. At this point, I was pretty pumped for this album to come out, and she did not disappoint. She took all of the best parts of her previous work and built on them to make the fantastic “Jubilee”. “Paprika” serves as a perfect opening track, with the best vocal performance from Michelle (which is saying something as this is a record filled with great vocal performances). The album then transitions into the catchiest pop song you’ll ever hear, “Be Sweet”, with jangling guitars, a groovy bass, and the best chorus you can ever have. It’s not a coincidence that this track was my most played song of 2021 according to apple music. To finish off an incredibly album opening, the sweet “Kokomo, IN”, an acoustic ballad with a silky smooth lead guitar (and covered by Jeff Tweedy, which is crazy for Michelle as she may be the only bigger Wilco fan in the world than me). There are just so many amazing pop tracks littered throughout this album, it’s difficult to write about it concisely (including “Savage Good Boy”, “Slide Tackle”, “Posing in”Bondage”). She even closes the record strongly on “Posing For Cars”, ending with a kick ass guitar solo. It’s a such a great feeling to look forward to a new album from an an up and coming artists only for them to fully deliver.

    "text": "1. Wolf Alice: Blue Weekend\nIf there is one word I would use to describe 2021’s album of the year, it’s consistent. This album, front to back is just consistently great. Coming off the great success of “Visions of Life”, Wolf Alice returns with “Blue Weekend”, doubling down on the almost stadium-rock influences that made Visions of Life so freaking good. Perhaps the most noticeable thing is the incredible vocals from the lead singer Ellie Rowsell. She just absolutely goes for it in so many different tracks. “Delicious Things” starts things off with a vibe that is prevalent throughout the record, with much of the patented whispered verses before erupting into the heavy guitars and harmony layered chorus that make Wolf Alice so amazing. Another such song, “Lipstick on the Glass” has this great almost marching band beat to the snare drum that I think fits so well with the track. “Smile” showcases the louder, alternative rock side of the group, filled with fuzzy guitars and big vocals. A cool departure from their typical sound is the harmony ladened acoustic ballad “Safe From Heartbreak (if you never fall in love)”, which the line “you fucked with my feelings” is such amazing moment not just on the song, but for the whole record. “Play the Greatest Hits” serves as a fun noise track that breaks things up little to help with the pacing of the album. “Last Man on Earth” is the fantastic piano ballad that builds that I can only imagine must be amazing a live show. Writing about this album has me feeling the same way as when I chose it as my top album for 2021; there are just so many damn good songs on this record. Its not a large departure from the typical sound we’ve come to know from Wolf Alice, but they have absolutely perfected their art. In this writeup, I wrote about half the tracks on the album, which just shows how many of them I truly love. In many ways, it serves as the perfect album for my 2021 list, while maybe not the most experimental or most ambitious, but above all just sounding so good. And honestly, I’m not sure music is supposed to do anything else.\n\nKey Tracks: Delicious Things, Smile, Safe From Heartbreak (if you never fall in love), The Last Man on Earth"

    "text": "My second ever top albums list fell on my junior and senior years at ESF. I was pretty happy with how my first list came out (1s of people thought it was pretty cool), so I spent more time looking for more new music. This was also the year that I got my first record player and my first 4 vinyls which included:\nA pretty great collection if you ask me. I also was off a great senior year of soccer, going undefeated in our league leading to a trip to nationals (where I would score two goals!). In general, my life was going pretty good. For this list, I was still trying to stick to 10 albums, which inevitably made led me to leave some albums I really enjoyed off. To remedy this, I included 4 honorable mentions. I also made my first top 100 songs playlist as well, and frankly, I think its pretty damn good, especially the number 1 pick “Sugar For the Pill” which remains one of my very songs from the 2010s. This ended being a pretty great soundtrack for my final year at ESF."

I was also super disappointed to leave this album off the top 10 list, and was the major reason why I included some honorable mentions. This is the followup to their amazing self-titled album, a clever indie-electronica album that sets the apart from other electronic artists. “What Now” is poppier and than its predecessor, perfectly epitomized by the brightly colored track “The Glow”. “Die Young” is a certified banger, detailing the annoyance having to hold off dying young because they found love. “Signal” is great pop anthem that’s worth blasting in your car with the windows rolled down. At it’s core, Sylvan Esso made an album chock full of great songs that ends up with the whole being greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nKey Tracks: The Glow, Die Young, Signal"

    "text": "3. Bon Iver: 22, A Million\nOn this list, albums 2 and 3 are essentially tied, which made picking their spots all the more difficult. We first start off with Bon Iver’s “22, A Million”, after 5 years since the breathtakingly beautiful self title record from 2011. That previous record in addition to the EP “Blood Bank” hinted at the experimentation Justin Vernon would eventually lean into. “22, A Million” is nearly unidentifiable from the debut “For Emma, Forever Ago”, drenched in reverb, autotune and dissonance. And yet, despite all these tricks, the album somehow remains authentic and organic, particularly on the rare occasions when just Justin’s unulterd voice appears. It’s a bit difficult to point out individual tracks as this album really doesn’t contain very many fully developed songs. Instead, tracks largely bleed into each other, sometimes making it difficult to tell if there was song changed. Really, this album is truly best enjoyed all in one sitting. A major standout for me is “715 - CRΣΣKS” (man these are a pain to type out) showcasing just the autotuned harmonies of Justin, that use the spaciousness of the song to its advantage. “8 (circle)” is almost sounds like a something high schoolers would slow dance to in 80s and contains this amazing horn section at minute 3 that I adore. The album ends with “00000 Million”, grounding us as it strips back most of the crazy production leaving behind just choir of vocals and a standup piano, and I just find incredibly comforting. Perhaps the greatest strength of this record is Bon Iver finding ways to push the limits of his sound without losing what makes his music great.\n\nKey Tracks: 715 - CRΣΣKS, 8 (circle), 00000 Million"

They also cover each other’s songs with Kurt covering the classic “Out of the Woodwork”, while Courtney covers “Peepin Tom” (a version that I prefer, despite loving the original).

There is so much great songwriting and vocals performances on this record that I’m always happy to talk about, such as the breadth of topics on the title track including human brains being to big to birthed at full size, ending on the great line “I hate to say it, but each other is all we got”. Or the beautiful country-esque ballad on “Smoochie”, describing someone comforting John (or Father John?). And yet, John gets in his own way with these endless self-indulgent tracks like “Leaving LA” or “So I’m Growing Old on Magic Mountain”. These problems really prevent an good album from becoming a great album despite the numerous great songs. Still, I enjoy much of this project, which was enough to warrant an honorable mention, evening if I grumble about it.\n\nKey Tracks: Pure Comedy, Smoochie, Ballad of a Dying Man"

    "text": "5. Peter Silberman: Impermanence\nAn aspect of music that I really enjoy when it’s done well is the use of spaciousness, particularly when it emphasizes something within the music like a melody or to highlight a lyric. “Impermanence” takes this to another level. Peter Silberman (famously of the Antlers and creator of one of the most tragic records ever made “Hospice”) recorded this album after recovering from hearing loss in one ear. This hearing loss inspired him to take a minimalistic approach with just faint touches of guitar, syntths, and his angelic voice. “Karuna” is my favorite, as it opens with just the occasional strum of the guitar and Peter’s powerful vocals before building ever so slightly to include more involved guitar work and just a bit of drums. “New York” explores Peter’s noticing and being overwhelmed by noises in New York City that he once took for granted. The album closes as it should, with simple ambient track on “Impermanence”. This is a such unique project that tries to explore the loneliness of deafness with sound (or the lack there of). It may be a bit difficult for some people to get into it due to its spareness, but incredibly rewarding if you spend time with it.\n\nKey Tracks: Karuna, New York, Ahimsa"

This album contains a whopping 109! tracks and a run time of 3.5 hours. It’s a collection of spoken word, ambient music, industrial music, and occasionally singer songwriter. This album is pure chaos, with little structure or consideration for the next song. In fact, the tracklist is in alphabetical order, implying that the artist is fine with people putting the album on shuffle. I highly recommend doing this as it gives you a unique listening experience each time. I’m still trying to fully wrap my head around this album, but I’ve fallen in love with it and will be on the look out for albums like in for next year. The reason I put this as an honorable mention, as it really doesn’t feel like an album that I can compare to others, but I wanted to point it out at the same time. It’s a pretty daugting task, looking at 3.5 hour album, so some tracks to try first probably would include “Carefully”, “Battling Dust” and “Badman”. I suspect most people won’t be into this, but I still hope you’ll give it a try, as it’s the craziest thing album I’ve added to a end of year list.\n\nKey Tracks: Carefully, Battling Dust, Hide, Office, Badman, and many more"

The album opens with the best track “Habitat” starting with loud guitars, before the song deconstructs into the beautiful acoustic section complete with nature sounds in the background, before transitioning in the urgent “Alaska”. “Orange”, a song the placed very high on my top songs of 2021, returns for 11:11 and remains as necessary as ever. My only minor gripe with this album is how little of the rest of the very talented band we get to see on this record.

This album just contains so many alt-pop gems that are fit for any summer soundtrack. Like other pop artists I’m loving in this day in age, there is a subtlety to the way he approaches his songs both in writing and vocal performances. “Grapejuice” has this great ringing guitar note throughout the track combined with banging piano chords that pair perfectly with his revered vocals that create a relaxed vibe. “Keep Driving” has this great dreamy aesthetic to it that makes you want to get lost on a road trip with someone you love. Finally, Matilida has this amazing acoustic guitar part that to this day still eludes me, despite my best efforts to learn it. This is furhter evidence to me that pop music is in a really great place.\n\nKey Tracks: Grapejuice, Matilda"

But the real standout is the lead vocalist, Zayna Youssef, who is the absolute perfect frontwoman for this band, bringing so much charisma to each every song. In particular, her vocals on “High Hopes” is extraordinary, brimming personality and swagger. Hands down my favorite vocal performance of the year, and just missed out on being my favorite song.

But, they keep the thing they makes them a special band; the ability to craft anthems (classics like Archie, Marry Me and In Undertow). “Easy on Your Own” is a perfect example of this, as it builds to big emotional climax that I imagine would be amazing to see live. Most of the album contains songs with pretty quick tempos, which makes feel like its in a rush and ends before you even know it. This make it easy to listen to over and over. “Belinda Says” is my personal favorite; another anthem that has such incredible key change towards the back of the song.

This album is just filled with psychedelic rock and r&b tracks that bleed into each other wondefully. The album starts off boldly, with a guitar features from the super talented Unknown Mortal Orchestra on “The Medium” before going into the saxophone ladened “Goes By So Fast”. “The Loop” is a song I dare anyone not to bop their head to, as laments getting stuck in a boring routine that is making time pass too fast.

The album opens with “Bones”, which is not wildly distinct from her previous work before it transitions into the grunge heavy”With U”, with thick distorted guitars and muted verses. The lead single “Shotgun” is probably the best track on the record, finding the perfect balance between her ear-wormy songwriting style and this new found grudge style. She closes with “Still”, another track reminiscent of her older work that just feels so fitting to end the album with.

There is this ominous feeling that surrounds the album, driven by the melancholy piano and hushed vocals from Koen van de Wardt. Still, there are bright spots on the record, like “Plastic Gun”, which has synth and bass lines that goes pretty hard, or the ringing chorus on “Disguiser”. I love how the album closes, with “Syliva”, a slow burn track with a sing-along chorus that serves a perfect conclusion for the indie-pop adventure this album takes you on.

Compared to their instant classic “Morbid Stuff”, which contained straight ahead pop-punk and emo-rock sounds, PUPTHEBAND goes for a nosier, less polished sound, particularly towards the back of the album. As the album evolves, the tracks become less melodic and become more chaotic, more than likely symbolizing the bands inevitable unraveling. I find the piano skits/interludes endlessly entertaining, as the band is running out of money trying to finish a record and fighting. “Totally Fine” is such a great way to start the record, starting off chaotic before settling back into the farmilar melodic choruses of their previous work. “Matilda” is another highlight of the record, containing the perfect chorus to scream-sing to (and which I did in person in the at a show in the summer of 2022). As someone who grew up on Green Day, pop-punk is always going to have a special place in my heart.

His previous record “House of Sugar” is indie-folk gem and was my second favorite record of 2019 (a pretty stacked year). On “God Save The Animals”, I still haven’t figured out exactly why I love this album so much. On paper, much of it seems like simple indie folk songs you’ve heard a lot times. But I don’t know, there is just something special going on in the background. “Runner” has the infectious melody to it, with a piano bringing the song to life. I also love how he says “they hit you with a rolled up magazine”. Even with the deceiving songwriting approach to this record, Alex finds ways to bring back his famous experimental songs that just about every album has like on “S.D.O.S” and “Blessing”. “Miracles” is another beautiful track that just brings me so much comfort, with Alex’s fragile vocal performance and the fiddle in the background. My best guess to what makes this album click with me is that Alex G, despite all of production tricks he brings to music, there is core sincerity to everything he does and God save the Animals has boatloads of it.

The album starts with a bong rip to the 20th Century Fox drum roll before the guitars start in on “Gold Chain Punk”. The song starts off fairly bright before getting more and more chaotic and by the end you can’t ever recognize where you came from. There is tons of anxiety in the lyrics (if you can keep up) that make the song so much more real. The band is also incredibly talented, constantly changing tempo and the approches to their sound, which keeps the album feeling fresh. “Jump!! (Or Get Jumped!!!)(by the future)” is an absolute whirlwind of a track that changes tempo so many times you get whiplash. “Driponomics” is such a mood change for the record, moving to truly insane beat instead where GG gets to really show off his flow (and super cool feature from Mother Maryrose). I’ll also love any song that comes after Reganomics. This album is so unique in its approach and just hits so go damn hard. Not sure there is a more thrilling album than this released in 2022.\n\nKey Tracks: Gold Chain Punk (whogonbeatmyass), Driponomics, Jump!! (Or Get Jumped!!!)(by the future)"

    "text": "10. The Beths: Expert in a Dying Field\nThe Beths are becoming a force in indie-rock. Their first two albums are full of sugar sweet power-pop songs that just feel so good. On “Expert in A Dying Field”, they have truly outdone themselves here with the catchiest tracklist yet. Everything about this album is just so charming and infectious, whether is the sweet vocals from Elizabeth Stokes or the clear chemistry this band has with one another. The title track is such a well crafted song, starting off fairly reserved, before building to the end with their classic call and response harmonies between Elizabeth and the whole band. This call and response is utilized throughout the album and I love it every single time because it just adds so much personality. “Silence is Golden” is neat little musical experiment for the group with rapid lyrics from Elizabeth and drum beat that I can only imagine is really difficult to keep on tempo. “Head in The Clouds” is another fantastic track that has the band almost serve as doo wop group with their back up vocals. It’s amazing to me that after all of the indie-rock music that has been released in the past 20 years or so, there is still life in the genre. Bands like The Beths are the exact reason why I keep coming back to it.\n\nKey Tracks: Expert in A Dying Field, Head in the Clouds, Silence is Golden"

    "text": "9. Weyes Blood: And in The Darkness, Hearts Aglow\nYet another stunner from Weyes Blood. Weyes Blood blew up with her tremendous album “Titanic Rising”, combining psychedelic production techniques with 70s singer songwriter vibes and the results are breathtaking. Here on “And in The Darkness, Hearts Aglow”, the second album of a triology, she takes a step back from some (but no all) of the production, making the songs feel a bit more organic. “It’s Not Just Me, It’s Everybody” is content to swim it’s own aesthetic, letting Natalie Mering’s voice carry you through the song. A real highlight is”Children of the Empire” , an expansive track with strings, drums, bells, harmonies, and some pretty great snapping. But the real show stopper for me is “God Turn Me Into A Flower”, a patient track containing just synth lines and a truly incredible vocal performance from Natalie. The outro to the track has this great ambient section that works nature songs into that is really stunning. “A Given Thing” is a perfect way to close the record, a piano ballad to close proceedings with another stunning vocal performance from Natalie. This album doesn’t have the same studio tricks as her previous album, but I feel like this album does a better job showcasing what a truly incredible singer Natalie Mering is. The only thing left to say is I cannot wait for the final album in the trilogy.\n\nKey Tracks: God Turn Me Into A Flower, Children of the Empire, A Given Thing"

    "text": "8. Jockstrap: I Love You Jennifer B\nIn September, I was looking one more kinda experimental record to add to my top 10 list. Enter the duo of Georgia Ellery (also a member of Black Country, New Road crazily enough) and Taylor Skye, under the name “Jockstrap”. “I Love You Jennifer B” is this incredibly collection of glitch pop and electronic songs that keep you guessing throughout the record. The album opens pretty unassuming with “Neon” before it explodes in a rush of guitars and keyboards out of nowhere. There is so much cool production on the vocal performances from Georgia, like on “Angst”, speeding up the track, which feels almost unsettling. “The Greatest Hits” is a real highlight for, with a such a catchy beat and keyboard part that I always bop my head along to. But my personal favorite is on “What’s it All About”, this dreamy track with strummed acoustic guitar and string flourishes that make for a really beautiful song. There so many other tracks with crazy production that I really don’t have time to get into detail with like “Concrete Over Water” or “Glasgow”. Please spend time with this album, you’ve never heard anything quite like it.\n\nKey Tracks: What’s It All About, Greatest Hits, Concrete Over Water"

    "text": "7. Florist: Florist\nI first discovered Florist with their 2017 record “If Blue Could Be Happiness” and fell in love with the title track. They just create these spacious songs that are so peaceful that sound like something that could come out of Adventure Time (particularly the end credits song). On their self titled record, they build on this by creating a minimulaistic indie-folk record that borders on ambient at times. Throughout, there are these great little production parts that add so much to such bare bone songs. The lead vocals are perfect for this album, matching the peaceful songwriting approach. This is a pretty long album, with 19 tracks coming in a just short of 1 hour makes it difficult to handpick tracks, but “Sci-Fi Silence” and “Two Way”s are tracks that really stand out to me. I really enjoy the ambient tracks throughout the record that include bells, rain, and subtle guitars (like on “Duet for Guitar and Rain”). They also serve to help prevent the record for dragging on or overstaying its welcome. This album even has a minimalistic jam on the track “43”, which has the great guitar solo towards the end of it. This album is such a perfect way to declutter my brain, particularly on stressful days at work or as I’m falling asleep. Florist have really outdone themselves with this work.\n\nKey Tracks: 43, Two Ways, Sci-Fi Silence."

    "text": "6. Beach House: Once Twice Melody\nNormally, I’m not a particularly big fan of double albums, as in attempt to fill out the tracklist, artists sometime include weaker songs that could have been removed for a tighter single album. But it seems 2022 was a major exception to that rule, and I can’t be surprised that the dream pop masters were the ones to do it. The release of this album may have help in part with it, as they released it 4-5 songs at a time, which helped the audience digest the individual tracks more easily. What can I say, its another Beach House triumph. The self title track is a perfect way to open the album, with plucky acoustic guitars, lush strings, and Victoria’s ethreal vocals. “Pink Funeral” is one of my favorite tracks they’ve ever release, sounding a bit more sinister compared to their other work. This album contains so many songs that will likely become classic Beach House tracks, like “New Romance”, this big sounding track that feels so optimistic, especially as the chorus kicks in with the drum kit. “The Bells” has this fantastic ringing guitar to that I’m obsessed with. This album can feel a little bit daunting going into it, so approaching it the same way Beach House released the tracks is honestly a great way to become familiar with. Large tracklists can sometimes cause people to ignore certain songs. But on this record, just about every song requires your attention. Beach House remains the king and queen of dream pop.\n\nKey Tracks: Pink Funeral, New Romance, Once Twice Melody"

    "text": "5. Angel Olsen: Big Time\nIt’s becoming kind of absurd how much incredible music Angel Olsen has released, and Big Time is yet another incredible addition. The origins of the album are unfortunately tragic, as Angel had just came out gay to her parents and was greeted by love and acceptance, only for her to lose both of them suddenly a couple of weeks later. Really changes of the context of many of the songs. Angel had humorously billed this album as “not country, but it’s also not not country” which I think a perfect description. Tracks like “This is How It Works” and the title track, you can clearly hear country influences, particularly with the very prominent and well done pedal steel. Angel is still capable of creating a huge ballad with the opening track (and best track) “All the Good Times”. The line “the way that she said, as heavy as led, you know how to get straight to my head” gives me chills on every listen. “Ghost On” is another great ballad that flows so beautifully before the great guitar solo comes in towards the end of the album. As with any Angel Olsen record, her iconic vocals shine through on just about every track, which elevates already great songwriting to another level. The final track “Chasing the Sun” is an emotional ending to the album as Angel surrenders to the love she has found. I’m getting to the point of running out of superlatives for Angel. All I can say is give this record many listens.\n\nKey Tracks: All The Good Times, Big Time, Ghost On"

They always had cool experimental jazz and rock ideas but I just could never quite get into it. On “Hellfire” they manage to find the perfect balance between their wild experimental art rock with some truly beautiful moments of jazz. The album opens with the title track, which feels like an introduction to what you’ll hear on the record as it transitions into the masterpiece that is “Sugar/Tzu”. The track opens with a boxing announcer getting you ready for the craziness that is about to ensue. The song the sprints into outrageous arpeggios and jazz played a rapid pace. The song ends with horns erupting and some unbelievable drums lines. It then cleanly transitions in the equally crazy “Eat Men Eat”. Its baffling how many musical ideas this band manages to fit into a pretty short album (39 minutes in total) without ever feeling unfocused or forced. “The Race is About to Begin” is case study in this, shifting in and out of crazy guitar riffs and unhinged vocal deliveries, before settling into something akin to a lullaby. “Still” is among the sweeter moments on the record with some wonderful acoustic guitar, especially around the 2 minute mark. “Dangerous Liaisons” plays almost like a jazz standard, with gorgeous horn sections and piano, which would feel almost out of place on the record if wasn’t Black Midi playing. This is one of the most ambitious records released in 2022 and they really just nail it. It’s a record that a lot of people man not get into right away, but there is some many cool things going on, its absolutely worth spending time with.\n\nKey Tracks: Sugar/Tzu, The Race is About to Begin, Still"

    "text": "3. Ethel Cain: Preacher’s Daughter\nTrigger warning for some pretty heavy stuff on this record. My first impressions when this record came out were fairly positive. It was a slowburn kind of record with some cool studio production and pretty distinctive vocalist in Hayden Silas Anhedönia. But there was just an extraordinary buzz in the online music communities I’m involved with that I just wasn’t seen. As I was relistening to this record as I was getting ready to start my list, I decided to do a little more research on the album and really study the lyrics. I was shocked at what I found. For starters, I didn’t recognize this was considered a slowcore record, which allowed me to approach the record from another angle. But the real change was learning about the story within the album. This story follows Ethel, a daughter of preacher in rural southern town. “American Teenager” serves a character development, exploring Ethel’s desire to leave her hometown in search of something more, trying to heal from the end of a relationship. The album only gets more somber from here, on “House in Nebraska”, dealing with the crushing loneliness of her love abandoning her in the very same town she wants out of. She does eventually leave but ends up with a incredibly toxic and violent man on “Western Nights”, who eventually dies at the hands of the police during a bank robbery. The A side closes on “Family Tree”, as Ethel explores the likely sexual assault from her father and the complicated feelings between her hatred for him and yet unable to not love him anyway. You think Ethel as finally found true love in “Thoroughfare” as she travels to California with a kind stranger named Isiah, before falling in love with him. But the rug is ripped from under the listener, as Ethel is drugged up and pimped out on “Gibson Girl”. She begins to hallucinate on the dark, industrial song “Ptolemaea” as confronts the demons before her. Ethel screaming “Stop” is gives me chills every time I hear. On “August Underground” Ethel attempts to escape from Isaiah but to no avail, and is eventually killed by his hands, represented by the piano interlude “Televangelism” representing her ascent to heaven. Ethel on the closing two tracks comes terms with her death, worrying about her mother never learning about what happened to her, as Isaiah cannibalizes her body (yes you read that right). I don’t know if I’ve ever had an album give such visceral reaction before. The terror that Ethel faces just leaves a pit in my stomach. I wouldn’t say this album is “enjoyable” (though it is beautiful). But it’s a true work of art that I think won’t be matched for a while. It’s a tough listen, but one worth going through.\n\nKey Tracks: Ptolemaea, Strangers, Televangelism, Hard Times"

    "text": "2. Big Thief: Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe You\nThis is probably a good album to listen to after the Ethel Cain record….. I’m running out of words to describe what an amazing band Big Thief is. They just continue to release incredible record after incredible record. I’ve heard a lot people get excited that Big Thief released a country album, but honestly does this is a disservice. They cover all kinds of ground in the indie-folk and singer songwriter realm, from traditional Americana, to more experimental indie-folk, blue grass and more. I think the best comparison is maybe The Beatles’s “The White Album”, but only in the sense of the long tracklist with its sprawling sounds. The album opens sweetly, with the simple indie-folk song “Change” that has this delightful guitar solo from their lead guitarist, Buck Meek. In then transitions into the frantic “Time Escaping”, with a cacophony of sounds. “Spud Infinity” is this great blue grass song, complete a jaw harp (which required the funniest google search to figure out what the hell it was called). The album then goes into my favorite on the album “Certainty”. Its such a simple little song, but its so playful, and I just adore Adrianne Lenker’ss vocal performance on it and the lose harmonies from Buck. Big Thief produce such a crazy sound on “Little Things” with echo acoustic guitars layered by one of my favorite ever guitar performances from Buck. There doesn’t seem to be a ton of song structure to it, but it just works so well. It then transitions perfectly into the criminally brief “Heavy Bend”, with it’s plucky guitar and crisp drumbeat. I’ve talked about a lot of songs already and I’m not even halfway through the tracklist which just shows how much incredibly good music is on this album. The second half opens with amazing bluegrass tune “Red Moon” where Adrianne really leans into the twang in her vocal delivery. “No Reason” is another favorite of my, with the stunning flute solo on the bridge of the song and the lovely camrodory of the band as they together sing “come together”. “12,000” lines isa peaceful folk tune with fantastic vocal performance from Adrianne. Then there is “Simulation Swarm”, a catchy indie-folk tune that has this intrigue and mystery to it, as crescendos and backs off throughout the song, and feels like its destined to become a fan favorite. The album closes with one more country track, “Blue Lightning” with great messy lead guitars from Buck again, acting a perfect way to bring all of this together. This record has 20 songs and runs from 1 hour and 20 minutes. And yet, it doesn’t drag even a little bit. There is such comfort to how Big Thief approach this work. Its peaceful, playful, friendly, and above all, amazing executed. I dare say this is their best work yet and album that I will come back to time and time again.\n\nKey Tracks: Certainty, Reasons, Simulation Swarm, Little Things"

    "text": "1. Black Country New Road: Ants from Up There\nIt was going to take something pretty damn special to beat Big Thief’s latest release; Black Country, New Road have done just that. It’s honestly pretty hard to describe how much I love this record. I’ve just listened to some many times this year. It’s a pretty substantial departure from the post-punk approach they took on their terrific debut “For the first time”, opting for a chamber pop type sound instead. This allows for each of the instruments to have more profound role on the record and they put that to good use. The “Intro” starts like their first album, a fun instrumental but rather than a jam, serves a introduction to the album’s sound instead. It transitions into the almost silly “Chaos Space Marines” with dramatic piano and saxophones blasting as the song drives forward. It just sounds like the band is having such fun with this track. It then goes into the amazing “Concorde”, containing the understated iconic vocals from Isaac Wood. I just love how the saxophone and keyboard harmonizes on the second half of the song before it builds an emotional climax. “Bread Song” contains more rising saxophones and simple drums and guitar strums. A big highlight of the record falls on “Good Will Hunting”, with a pound of synth keys bringing you into the song. The way Issace sing “she has Billie Ellish style, moving to Berlin for a little while” just sounds so cool in his baritone voice. The front half of the album contains the shorter, more single type songs, but the real magic is on the back half. The B-side starts with the truly remarkable “The Place Where He Inserted the Blade”, my favorite song of 2022. It opens with somber piano chords and a breathtaking flute before Issac opens with the lines “your scared of the world where you’re needed”. Issac then belts the lines that I just love to sing along to “How come every time I try to make lunch for anyone else in my head, I get lost dreaming of you, and you come to me”. It’s just a line that gets stuck in your head. On the first chorus, the flute remains present, but is then replaced by a saxophone on the second first, giving the song more power. After the second verse, the whole band comes in seeing along to the melody, a moment that always overwhelms me emotionally. We then go into the 9 minute “Snow Globe”, a slow burn song with motif-esque guitar lines and a swelling violin part. There is some pretty incredible percussion on the back half of the track that really show case that the talent of the drummer/percussionist. Finally we get to the epic finale that is “Basketball Shoes”, the only song fitting to end this masterpiece. This 12 minute journey begins with instruments entering the song one by one, with a gorgeous harmonies between the saxophone and violinist. Issac the comes with hushed vocals to accompany the beautiful instrumentation surrounding him. The song the quickly transitions to post-punk sound familar on their first album, but only for brief moment. Each instrument the plays a singular note in order before erupting together playing the same melody. The song then builds tension for the big finale, with echoing drums and Isacc lamenting “in my bedsheets are now wet, with Charlie I pray to forget”. The band then just unleashes, giving everything they got as they sing together one last time. Its such a perfect end to a perfect album. This album hits me quite a bit harder following the news that Issac Woods left the band to tend to his mental health. This album almost feels like a goodbye in many ways. Still, I hope Issac receives the help he needs and can live a happy life. It goes without saying that this album is my front runner for not just album of the year, but album of the decade. It’s been a lot time since a piece of music has resonated with me as much as the work did. It’s something truly special.\n\nKey Tracks: The Place Where He Inserted the Blade, Basketball Shoes, Good Will Hunting, Concorde, basically the whole album"

I also met my lovely girlfriend Karen, which has been a wonderful addition in my life. World events have been somewhat positive as well. The war in Ukraine has been going considerably better than anyone (besides Ukraine) could have imagined. COVID is starting to become a more mildly and losing it’s ability to collapse the health care system. Perhaps the biggest develop in my field was the passage of the inflation reduction act, which is mostly a giant climate bill throw $350+ billion dollars in various ways at tackling greenhouse gas emissions in various ways, which has given me more hope that U.S. is actually going to do something about climate change.\nOn top of all of the relatively positive news this year, 2022 was a truly incredible year of music. I have never had so much trouble deciding on my list this year, with 11 albums that probably would have made the top 25 albums any other year that didn’t make this year. Artists I had to leave off have made other lists in the past including Wilco, Nick Hakim, Andrew Bird and Alt-J. The top 10 is arguably the strongest I’ve made, with the final positions of albums really unclear to me until a week or so to making my list. Lastly, my favorite album from this year is the front runner for album of the decade and one I come back to constantly. All in all, it’s been a pretty good year for me."
