A new president was elected, vaccines for COVID-19 were distributed, the world began opening up again and during the fall, I moved to Boulder Colorado from September to December. This list was probably one of my less experimental years of music, with a fantastic year for women in music (9 out 10 artists in the top 10 and 18 of the top 25 albums were female artists or bands led by women)."

    "text": "My First List\nApproaching finals week, I unsurprisingly was finding myself in the library quite frequently either studying or working on final class projects. I was looking for something to help things bit more bearbile. It then I stumbled on to two different music outlets. The first was the website Album of the Year. Album of the year is social network/blog type website not dissmilar to sites like Rate Your Music. However, an important difference here is that also as a database for both reviews for critics and users of the website. Since it was early December, we were in “list season”; where major publications release their lists for the top albums of the year. Album of the year was also compiling this information to create an average albums of the year list.\nThe second outlet is from an NPR podcast that I had already been regularly listening to for about year at this point; All Songs Considered. A wonderful music podcast hosted by Bob Boilen (the same person who created Tiny Desk Concerts) and Robin Hilton. They had just released a pod discussing listener picks for the best albums of the year. For whatever reason, I found (and still find this…) fascinating. This got me thinking about what my favorite albums of the past year were. I then wrote down some 30 albums, and listened to each one during finals week and picked my 10 favorites. I h\n\n\nGoing Forward\nThis project is here for 3 major purpose:\n\nCompile all of my lists and playlists into one place for ease of access\nImprove coding and writing skills with a website/pseudoblog project\nMake it easier to share my favorite music with a potentially larger audience\n\nI"

The music quality in 2016 was just amazing, with amazing albums I don’t cover here that include (and are not limited to) David Bowie’s final record “Blackstar”, Anderson Paak’s “Malibu”, Frank Ocean’s “Blonde”, Pinegrove’s “Cardinal”, and Deerhoof’s “The Magic” (which remains my favorite album of theirs from a very long and impressive catalog). The albums that are on this list still find their way into my listening queues on fairly regular basis. I also didn’t make a top songs playlist to accompany the album list so I’ll name a handful tracks that remain favorites to me, but tracks that really stand out to me from this year include:\nPlus tons of other songs, some of which I feature in this list.

    "text": "This was a very significant year of change for me. I graduated from SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry in May 2018, and started my Ph.D in atmospheric sciences at the University of Albany a couple of weeks later. It seems fitting this was the year I decided switch up the format for the album of the list. If there was one year I could pick to redo a list for, it’s probably this one. I decided on choosing 40 albums rather than 10 or 25 as there was just a ton of albums I really liked that year that I wanted to represent in some way. Look back now, I was right; there are just a ton of albums that I enjoy that year. However, 40 was probably a few too many as there are a handful of albums that haven’t aged well for me. I would probably reshuffle the Top 10 pretty significantly as well. Albums like Low’s hauntingly beautiful and experimental “Double Negative” or Beach House’s subperb “7” probably deserve to be higher up on this list, while albums like Lucy Dacus’s “Historian” or the fun hot mess that is Anderson.Paak’s “Oxnard” probably should be lower on the list. Still, 2018 had a lot of music I really loved, and I often associate with graduation. It’s hard not to look back at this list with nostalgia."

    "text": "10. Mountain Man: Magic Ship\nThis is probably one of the most unique albums I’ve probably included on a top 10 list. This trio includes Amelia Meath of Slyvan Esso, Molly Sarlé, and Alexandra Sauser-Monnig of Daughter of the Swords, all who attended Bennington College together. Together, they produce a master class in minimalistic traditional and indie folk, opting for nothing more than simple acoustic guitar parts and their amazing vocal harmonies. Tracks like “Whale Song” and “Bright Morning Stars” use space perfectly to really necessitate their siren like vocal harmonies. The incredibly cozy and comforting, “Slow Wake Up Sunday Morning” is true highlight from this record, that is only made better in the context of the full album."

I found “Pure Comedy” to be a very frustrating album, containing some of FJM’s very best song writing, but often overshadowed by preachy and pretentious tracks (Leaving La being 11 minutes of just acoustic guitar…). “God’s Favorite Customer” was a pleasant surprise for me, with FJM returning to the vulnerability and lush instrumentation that made 2015’s “I Love You, Honeybear” so fantastic."

We had been hearing stuff on the news about COVID, but didn’t think things would get too bad. When I arrive at work, i find out that if I had shown up a day later, they weren’t going to let me in the building. A few days, we get the “go home for 2 weeks” instruction. A week later I packed my car back to go home, and not leave really leave home for a long time. To make things worse, the presidential election became an utter shit show, with election “night” stretching into election week. With all this in the background, this made for an odd year of music for me. I find that this list is a more melancholy or experimental than other years, which probably matches how I felt at the time. Still, despite all of the awfulness that came out of this year, I did manage to find some truly great music."

This album contains so many moments of pure psychedelic beauty, featuring wavy guitars, dreamy production, and layered harmonies. “Mother Please Don’t Be Sad” is an emotional gut punch, narrating from the perspective of a son trying to console his mother from the afterlife. The guitar and vocal harmonies in the middle of this track are truly breathtaking.\n\nKey Tracks: Mother Please Don’t Be Sad, Dinosaurs on the Mountain"

    "text": "14. Adrianne Lenker: songs\nWhen Adrianne Lenker is fronting one of the best bands in music, she also producing amazing solo records. This album coupled with the wonderful aptly named “instrumentals”, contains some of Adrianne’s best song writing. The very light production on the track “anything” bring a delicacy that compliment the vulnerability in the lyrics. This album also showcases what terrific guitar player Lenker is, dancing all over the neck of her guitar on songs like “two reverse”. I also love the sound that comes from her decision to play her guitar with a paintbrush on “dragon eyes” which gives the song just enough of a percussive sound. Yet another album that brought me a lot comfort this year.\n\nKey Tracks: Home, You and I"

    "text": "13. Caribou: Suddenly\nElectronic albums are typically pretty hit or miss for me, particularly house records, so I can sometimes (and unfairly) approach them with some hesitation. This album however, is a major exception. Caribou walks the fine line between experimental almost glitch poppy tracks (You and I) and fun, danceable tracks (Home). On top of that, this album is amazingly consistent, with rarely a dull moment on the record. If people find me more records like this, you could quickly turn me into an electronic music fan."

    "text": "12. Lomelda: Hannah\nThere is this amazing spaciousness to this record that draws me back to it fairly often. Many of the arrangements are often not much more than some simple acoustic guitar, a simple drum kit, and the sweet but casual vocals from Lomelda, and yet can be so impactful. The highlight of the album is “Hannah Sun” that starts with some simple strumming of an acoustic guitar with some synth for effect and slowly builds in volume only to fade away once again leaving just Lomelda and her guitar. Still, this album has moments of bigger sound like on the delightful “Wonder”, or a “Reach”, which sounds like it belongs on Weezer’s “Blue Album”, right after Undone. (I recognize this is the second Weezer reference I’ve made and I’m not sure why it’s keeps happening).\n\nKey Tracks: Hannah Sun, Wonder"

The opening track “Bittersweet” really sets the you up for how the rest of the record is going to be, with silky smooth arrangements and incredibly vocal performances. This album also includes a really amazing cover of Radiohead’s “Weird Fishes”, which as far as I’m concerned, her version is about 10 times better than the original. Hard to say much more than just an incredibly talented R&B artist made a wonderful record.\n\nKey Tracks: Bittersweet, Can’t Fight"

    "text": "10. Cindy Lee: What’s Tonight to Eternity\nThe album just absolutely fascinates me. On it’s base, many of the songs are pretty on face value. Yet, you have the lo-fi production surrounding the songs, making for a truly eerie listening experience. The halloween-esq “I Want You To Suffer” begins with this almost Scooby Doo vibe to it before descending into pure distortion and feed back that is honestly quite unsettling, before coming back into focus. The following track has this 1940s song quality to it, but feels like it’s being played on a broker radio playing in another room. The album closes on it’s best track, “Heavy Metal”, sharing a similar oldies song style to it, but has this infectious guitar riff, a swelling string section, and a sweet choir of vocals, ending an album that at times can be quite abrasive, on a beautiful note."
