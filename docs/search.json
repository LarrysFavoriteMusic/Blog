This list was probably one of my less experimental years of music, with a fantastic year for women in music (9 out 10 artists in the top 10 and 18 of the top 25 albums were female artists or bands led by women)."

    "text": "My First List\nApproaching finals week, I unsurprisingly was finding myself in the library quite frequently either studying or working on final class projects. I was looking for something to help things bit more bearbile. It then I stumbled on to two different music outlets. The first was the website Album of the Year. Album of the year is social network/blog type website not dissmilar to sites like Rate Your Music. However, an important difference here is that also as a database for both reviews for critics and users of the website. Since it was early December, we were in “list season”; where major publications release their lists for the top albums of the year. Album of the year was also compiling this information to create an average albums of the year list.\nThe second outlet is from an NPR podcast that I had already been regularly listening to for about year at this point; All Songs Considered. A wonderful music podcast hosted by Bob Boilen (the same person who created Tiny Desk Concerts) and Robin Hilton. They had just released a pod discussing listener picks for the best albums of the year. For whatever reason, I found (and still find this…) fascinating. This got me thinking about what my favorite albums of the past year were. I then wrote down some 30 albums, and listened to each one during finals week and picked my 10 favorites. I h\n\n\nGoing Forward\nThis project is here for 3 major purpose:\n\nCompile all of my lists and playlists into one place for ease of access\nImprove coding and writing skills with a website/pseudoblog project\nMake it easier to share my favorite music with a potentially larger audience\n\nI"

The albums that are on this list still find their way into my listening queues on fairly regular basis.

But as far as I’m concerned, Lucy’s biggest strength is her soothing voice, which enhances her words. “Map on the Wall” serves as a nice slow burn track, helping to fill out the rest of the album.

This record is filled with lush strings and subtle beats, topped off with Ry Cuming’s gentle vocals. In particular, “Howling” has this simple little bit and yet does so much to make the song an earworm. “Berlin” remains a super hit for this artist (179 million streams on spotify) and probably the best vocal performance on the record as Ry’s voice matches the guitar note for note in the background. A true highlight is the gorgeous “Beacon” led by the an orchestral string section the builds with guitars and percussion in the background. This album serves as a perfect late-night companion, and one that likely will find myself spending time with in the future.\n\nKey Tracks: Beacon, Howling"

This album opens strongly with the meloncholy instrumental track “Doolhof” with ringing guitars and plenty of bass, setting the scene for the rest of the album. “Hostage” is this amazing slow-burn track starting off as a modest alt-pop with subtle guitar and electronic drum kit before evolving into an expansive dream-pop climax. “Island” perfectly closes out the record with another slow build up, starting with a catchy beat and vocal melody while constantly building on the current song. Before you know it, you find yourself surrounded by synths and echoing guitars. This album remains a classic for me, and honestly a pretty cool find for this just being my first official list.\n\nKey Tracks: Hostage, Island"

This album follows the absolutely amazing “Burn Your Fire For No Witness”, which by in large was Angel Olsen’s breakout hit, and really outdoes herself. The album starts off with this incredible “Intern”, containing nothing but a synth and Angel’s iconic voice, before transitioning into the almost rockabilly “Never Mine”. If this album really demonstrates anything, its Angel’s ability to craft a well paced tracklist, with the front end filled with singles (including the lead single “Shut Up Kiss Me”), with the back end containing more B-side tracks like the dreamy “Those Were the Days”. The track “Sister” remains as one Angel’s best songs, with the front half containing a relaxed ballot that Fleetwood Mac would have been proud of, before building to a soaring guitar solo. This was a statement from Angel, not only in that she has the ability to change up her sound, but that she was going to be one of the most consistent songwriters in music.\n\nKey Tracks: Sister, Never Be Mine, Shut Up Kiss Me"

That being said, this album is criminally underrated in the Wilco catalog. This album only came a year after the well received “Star Wars” (an album title that was meant stir up a lawsuit that never materialized), containing tons of fun songs with fuzzy guitars, loose arrangements, and lackadaisical vocals from Jeff Tweedy. “Schmilco” follows a completely opposite formula, with tight arrangements, a minimalist approached, and some of Jeff’s most introspective lyrics to date. The album opens with “The Normal American Kids”, only featuring an acoustic guitar with lead electric flourishes and Jeff’s voice, exploring his frustration as an and drug use as an adolescent. “If I was Ever a Child” is reminiscent of the alt-country ascetic of “Being There”. “Locator” is an experimentation into a minimalist noise rock song, giving the album some sonic range. I love the very simple guitar/piano melody and almost whispered vocals on “Shrug and Destroy” that just set this wonderful hushed mood. Anything Wilco releases will immediately be compared to there legendary works from the late 1990s into the 2000s, which I think does a disservice to the albums individually. Turns out, even if a record isn’t a band’s best work, if you are as talented as Wilco, its still going to be pretty damn good.\n\nKey Tracks: If I Ever Was A Child, Locator, Shrug and Destroy"

Henson gained a cult following on is fantastic debut “Dear”, that contained largely guitar only tracks like “You Don’t Know How Lucky You Are”. Here, Henson opts for more piano driven tracks, bulstered by orchestral sections. Keaton Henson writes a truly beautiful song that can be difficult to get through. Much of the lyrical content is centered around a particularly painful break up and missing this person. The “Pugilist” starts similar to tracks on “Dear” before growing into the much larger sound that you come to expect from the rest of the album On “Alright” Henson talks about how he’s managing without this person, or lamenting losing this person on the closing track “How Could I Have Known”, that swells into emotional orchestral finale. This album is filled a lot of pain, but for those who can stand it, or those who just want bawl their eyes out, there is a lot of beauty to be found.\n\nKey Tracks: Holy Lover, Alright, I Should Have Known"

Every time I listen to “You and I” and can’t help hum along to the guitar part. She really shows off her guitar chops on “Memory Street”, ripping her way through a blues solo. The true stand out is the title track “Emotions and Math” with yet another catchy little riff played on the low E string and probably Margaret’s best vocal performance on the entire album. The simple studio approach to this album really allows the song writing stand on its own and I think is a real strength.

    "text": "2. Car Seat Headrest: Teens of Denial\nAs far as I’m concerned, there is no one in indie rock that is as ambitious as Will Toledo of Car Seat Headrest. I don’t mean in the sense of him being sonically adventurous or genre breaking but just huge is albums, with Teens of Denial being his masterpiece. For starters, this album contains not 1 but 2 ~10 minute ballads on the B-side of the record which I think really captures how hard Will was swinging for the fences. A major theme throughout the record is teenage agnst and the drug and alcohol use that often pairs with it. The album opens strong with punchy “Fill in the Blank” a track that could have been written by the Ramones before easy into the albums centerpiece “Vincent”. Vincent is such insane song, starting with just a ringing guitar, building tension and slowly loses control in chaotic climax. Immediately after, the album transitions in the heavy power chords on “Destroyed by Hippie Powers” which just kicks absolute ass. Another highlight is the the anthem against drunk driving “Drunk Drivers/Killer Whales” (though I never figured out what the killer whale is in reference to…). The Ballad of Costa Concorida is the second of the two ballads on the back end of the album that starts slow (with an interesting reference to Didos “White Flag”) before erupting into a grand finale. The ambition on this record is honestly a breath of fresh air and reminder that there is still life within the genre of rock.\n\nKey Tracks: Vincent, Drunk Drivers/Killer Whales, The Ballad of the Costa Concodria"

Andy Shauf is someone I listened to obsessively throughout college (so much so I was seriously considering driving to Toronto from Eastern NY to see him play the day before Thanksgiving), and was because of this album. The album contains incredibly lush arrangements including clarinets and strings, with every instrument (excluding the strings) being played by Shauf himself, allowing Andy to control every detail of the record. “The Party” is a concept album based around events at house party (but not necessarily during the same night). Andy Shauf’s soft voice serves as a perfect narrator to follow different individuals and exploring their thoughts or feelings. Feelings that people are to familiar like being jealous of how out going someone is (Eyes of Them All) or drunkenly embarrassing yourself (Twist Your Ankle). The album also follows two characters, Sherrie and her love interest Jeremy. “Early to the Party” follows Sherry, arriving awkwardly early to a party, with Andy perfectly captures the uncomfortable feelings behind this. On one of my favorite tracks on the album “To You”, Sherry uncomfortably attempts to share her feelings to Jeremy only to for her to back down. The Party even has real drama, with the track “Alexander All Alone”, Alexander collapses dead outside while smoking a cigarette (and oddly enough increases the body count on Andy Shauf records to 4). The album of closes perfectly, with “Martha Sways” as the narrator slows dances with Martha at the end of the party that reminds him of someone else, with lush strings bringing him (and the listener) into a daydream. The song closes with the lines “Martha Spins, and I catch her hand. She smiles and laughs, bringing me back” snapping us out of the daydream. It one of my very favorite music moments. I cannot express how much I love this album and as such, I chose it as my album of the decade for the 2010s.\n\nKey Tracks: The Magician, To You, Martha Sways, Early to the Party"

At this point, Kendrick has really solidified himself as one the greats in Hip Hop, and this album contains so much of that confidence on tracks like”DNA”.

The track “Baby” has one of the vibest introductions to it, and I’m in love with the guitar tones throughout. “Bus Song” was a breakout hit for Jay Som, containing bright lyrics and horn section (and I so here for the positivity towards public transportation). The album closes strongly with the woozy “For Light”, with distorted vocals and a bright guitar towards end of the track.

This album is just a masterclass it what makes dream pop so amazing, with bright melodic guitars, hushed and reverbed vocals, and an overall melancholy feeling behind it all. The album opens wonderfully with “Slomo” that have the two vocalists intertwining their voices as the ringing guitar envelopes them. “Star Roving” is a perfect track to zip down the highway to at night with the driving percussion and fuzzy guitars. But the absolute highlight is the masterpiece “Sugar For the Pill”. The ringing guitar melody that plays at the start and throughout the track is guaranteed to stick in your head, as the song exhibits cascading guitars before building to the incredibly climax towards the end of the song. The album closes with the beautiful piano ballad on “Falling Ashes”, a nice contrast to the rest of the album. This a perfect soundtrack to any late night driving or staying up late for school or work. It’s amazing that a band can take such a long hiatus only to create arguably their best work.

On many occasions, Feist inverts a typical song structure where the quietest parts are reserved for the chorus. Her use of dynamics make the album exciting as it can go from loud to quite to loud again at any moment. On “I Wish I Didn’t Miss You”, the guitar is strummed almost percussively that along with vocal effects, give the track a bit of a bite. There is tons of great guitar work throughout the album like on tracks like “I’m Not Running Away” and the title tracks. Perhaps the coolest moment on the album is the transition of “Any Party” into “A Man is Not His Song”, which then closes with a brief moment of metal in the background.

The record is the experimental, psychedelic R&B and Soul record that is filled with ambitious song writing and truly amazing production. The title track is a great example with a drum kit and fuzzier guitars as Nick’s vocals a drenched in reverb. The guitars come in full force towards the end of the track which just makes the song hit that much harder.”I Bet She Looks Like You” has this great ringing electric guitar part that evolves into a deliberately messy guitar solo that made it one of my favorite songs of the year. “Cuffed” has a great drum beat to it that makes the track feel almost like a jam, and has this really cool slowdown towards the end of track. The B-side of the record, Nick leans more into the production like on tracks “Miss Chew” and “The Want”, filled with layered harmonies and wacky vocal effects. The production on this record is just top notch and it gives so much personality to it, and you’d be hard pressed to find albums that do it better.\n\nKey Tracks: I Bet She Looks Like You, Cuffed, Green Twins, Miss Chew"

    "text": "1. Big Thief: Capacity\nThe album that made me fall in love with Big Thief. This band has become so important in my life and few artists are as consistent of songwriters as Adrianne Lenker (or efficient in their output). “Capacity” came dropped only a year after the incredibly well received debut album “Masterpiece” and solidified them as one of the best acts in indie rock. There is just so much incredibly songwriting and band arrangements throughout the track list, and some of Adiranne’s best lyrical work. “Pretty Things” opens the album with this a mysterious acoustic part exploring complicated feelings in femininity and masculinity during sex. Immediately following is truly wonderful “Shark Smile” that starts off with tumultuously before simply to a driving rhythm guitar part. The song details two young lovers right up until a car crash that kills just one. There is this amazing little guitar solo that Buck Meek does on this track that is so simple and yet is exactly what the song calls for (a playing style the Buck is particularly adept at). “Mythological Beauty” is another stunning song where Adrianne sings about her mother who had her a very young age, detailing her childhood including being rushed to the hospital while her mother held in arms covering her bloodied head with a rag. “Haley” contains a really cool guitar part, showing off Adiranne’s great guitar skills (and a song I have yet to figure out how to play). The emotional climax is on the breathtaking track “Mary”, a piano ballad that is just a true emotional gut punch and the standout for a lot of fans of this album. Big Thief has gone on to put out more truly incredible records, but somehow I always find myself coming back to this one.\n\nKey Tracks: Shark Smile, Mythological Beauty, Mary, Haley"

    "text": "This was a very significant year of change for me. I graduated from SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry in May 2018, and started my Ph.D in atmospheric sciences at the University of Albany a couple of weeks later. It seems fitting this was the year I decided switch up the format for the album of the list. If there was one year I could pick to redo a list for, it’s probably this one. I decided on choosing 40 albums rather than 10 or 25 as there was just a ton of albums I really liked that year that I wanted to represent in some way. Look back now, I was right; there are just a ton of albums that I enjoy that year. However, 40 was probably a few too many as there are a handful of albums that haven’t aged well for me. I would probably reshuffle the Top 10 pretty significantly as well. Albums like Low’s hauntingly beautiful and experimental “Double Negative” or Beach House’s subperb “7” probably deserve to be higher up on this list, while albums like Lucy Dacus’s “Historian” or the fun hot mess that is Anderson.Paak’s “Oxnard” probably should be lower on the list. Most regrettably, Pinegrove’s “Skylight” is suspiciously missing from this list, which I still cannot believe I didn’t include. Still, 2018 had a lot of music I really loved, and I often associate with graduation. It’s hard not to look back at this list with nostalgia."

This trio includes Amelia Meath of Slyvan Esso, Molly Sarlé, and Alexandra Sauser-Monnig of Daughter of the Swords, all who attended Bennington College together. Together, they produce a master class in minimalistic traditional and indie folk, opting for nothing more than simple acoustic guitar parts and their amazing vocal harmonies. Tracks like “Whale Song” and “Bright Morning Stars” use space perfectly to really necessitate their siren like vocal harmonies. The incredibly cozy and comforting, “Slow Wake Up Sunday Morning” is true highlight from this record, that is only made better in the context of the full album."

I found “Pure Comedy” to be a very frustrating album, containing some of FJM’s very best song writing, but often overshadowed by preachy and pretentious tracks (Leaving La being 11 minutes of just acoustic guitar…). “God’s Favorite Customer” was a pleasant surprise for me, with FJM returning to the vulnerability and lush instrumentation that made 2015’s “I Love You, Honeybear” so fantastic."

We had been hearing stuff on the news about COVID, but didn’t think things would get too bad. When I arrive at work, i find out that if I had shown up a day later, they weren’t going to let me in the building. A few days, we get the “go home for 2 weeks” instruction. A week later I packed my car back to go home, and not leave really leave home for a long time. To make things worse, the presidential election became an utter shit show, with election “night” stretching into election week. With all this in the background, this made for an odd year of music for me. I find that this list is a more melancholy or experimental than other years, which probably matches how I felt at the time. Still, despite all of the awfulness that came out of this year, I did manage to find some truly great music."

The highlight of the album is “Hannah Sun” that starts with some simple strumming of an acoustic guitar with some synth for effect and slowly builds in volume only to fade away once again leaving just Lomelda and her guitar. Still, this album has moments of bigger sound like on the delightful “Wonder”, or a “Reach”, which sounds like it belongs on Weezer’s “Blue Album”, right after Undone.

The halloween-esq “I Want You To Suffer” begins with this almost Scooby Doo vibe to it before descending into pure distortion and feed back that is honestly quite unsettling, before coming back into focus. The following track has this 1940s song quality to it, but feels like it’s being played on a broker radio playing in another room. The album closes on it’s best track, “Heavy Metal”, sharing a similar oldies song style to it, but has this infectious guitar riff, a swelling string section, and a sweet choir of vocals, ending an album that at times can be quite abrasive, on a beautiful note."

Compared to previous works that had Nick’s vocals under tons of reverb, his voice feels more out in front with beautiful arrangements that compliment this so nicely. My favorite song on the record “Gods Dirty Work” has this amazing contrast between a strummed acoustic and a silky smooth lead guitar that just play off each other in way that I’m just in love with. The peaceful “Whoo” with a subtle flute notes towards the end, providing a perfect way to close this album. A great companion for relaxing evening.\n\nKey Tracks: Gods Dirty Work, Qadir, Whoo"

I love the technically proficient and yet deliberately off beat screeching guitar on “Sympathy for the Baby Boo” or the climbing scales in “Farewell Symphony” that descend into pure chaos in the second half of the record. “O Ye Saddle Babes” stands out has this fun, funky song, that almost feels dancable. The album ends with this lovely piano instrumental that almost feels like a palate cleanser at the end of wonderful but truly bizarre experience.

The album starts of strong with “Dotted Line” containing fantastic harmonies and a fantastic guitar riff that always gets stuck in my head. “The Alarmist” some their lead singer Evan Stephens Hall’s absolutely best song writing tied to one of his best vocal performances for the band, particularly on the bridge. “Moment” almost feels like a jam session on the back end of the track. The album also contains the prophetic “Endless” that Pinegrove described at one of their live shows as an “accidental pandemic song”.

It was released very suddenly in late September, as we approached the first dark winter of COVID for the U.S. and we were in the middle of the clusterfuck that was the 2020 presidential election. In short, things were scary and tense. The world needed (or at least I believe the world needed) this record. “Shore” feels like a sister album to the fantastic (and slightly underrated if you ask me) “Crack Up”. However, rather than the grandiose songwriting that can make the approaching the project a bit daunting, on “Shore” the Fleet Foxes simplified things to allow songs to work better on their own, and to wonderful effect. This is just this bright optimism on songs like “Sunblind” that filled me with comfort. “Featherweight” is a standout track on the record, open with plucky acoustic guitar and an almost sea-faring vibe to it. As all Fleet Foxes albums, their are layered harmonies, folk acoustics that border on medieval aesthetics , and the undeniably melodic lead vocals from Robin Pecknold. I’m not sure I’ve ever had an album that came at such a perfect time in my life more than this and it’s hard not to come back to this album with the exact same feeling.\n\nKey Tracks: Sunblind, Featherweight, Can I Believe You"

    "text": "3. illuminati hotties: FREE I.H: This is Not the One You’ve Been Waiting For\nThis album honestly surprised me a bit. Sarah Tudzin illuminati hotties released a really fun power pop/indie rock record in 2018, so I was interested to find out that this project was releasing a new album. However, this is no typical follow record, really considered more of a mixtape. At its core, this album is a punk album, filled with great production and biting lyrics. “Freed Ppls” is this almost speed metal like track that hits hard and collapses into chaos. “Content//Bedtime” is the describes the all too real feeling of a having a day being filled with just work then bed (probably a little to well…). Another striking thing about this record is it’s brevity, coming in at a very quick 23 minutes with only 1 song lasting longer than 2 and half minutes. Despite much of the album being recorded before the pandemic, the lyrics on “Free Dumb” reading “there was no love lost until you demand that I was non-essential” hits much harder in the context of 2020. And yet, it feels as if you get a full album experience. The closing track is a nice way to close out feelings of anger and anxiety, with Sarah thinking of things about loved ones that make her happy. This mixtape may not be the one we were supposed to wait for, but it’s hard to deny that something truly special was made here.\n\nKey Tracks: Free Ppls, Content/Bedtime, Melatonezone, Superiority Complex (Big Noise)"

    "text": "2. Andy Shauf: The Neon Skyline\nAbove all, Andy Shauf is a story teller. On his truly extraordinary “The Party”, Andy had already demonstrated his ability to craft a concept album. Here on the “Neon Skyline” Andy steps back the lush arrangements just a bit to allow for the story to take center stage, following a guy hearing about his ex-girlfriend returning to his hometown, only to run into her at while out at the bar, and unsuccessfully trying to make his move. This album is only about 34 minutes, and yet there is so much characterization throughout, whether it’s talking about reincarnation on “Dust Kids” or on the lounge-room like “Living Room” where a mother laments her acting like her father toward her own kid. Andy Shauf’s voice serves as a perfect narrator, providing a pleasant tone that doesn’t distract the story telling throughout the song. I’m just not aware of other artists that can capture the intimacy of relate able situations quite like Andy. The album closes perfectly with “Changer”, where the protagonist and his ex are just catching up talking about how the met and what brought them back to town, enveloped with a sweet but simple guitar part and Andy’s distinct clarinets. You truly feel like you have lived through this experience, and all in just 34 minutes.\n\nKey Tracks: Living Room, Changer, Try Again, The Neon Skyline"

I also am not sure this would be my album of the year if it was released on a different. But context matters so much when making these lists, and it was an obvious choice for the top spot in 2020. This just struck a perfect emotional chord with me. There is also just a truly amazing number of amazing songs. “Kyoto” is this fun ( well at least sonically) song with a memorable trumpet part to the track and chorus that’s just begging you to scream-sing along. “Saviors Complex” has this incredible melody that I can’t help but hum along with every time it comes on. “ICU” has the slow burn to it that builds to the amazing final chorus and has the great lyric ’I hate your mom, I hate when she opens her mouth. It’s amazing to me how much you can say when you don’t know what your talking about” The albums ends with the truly cathartic finale on “I Know the End”, ending with Phoebe just screaming, which was just such a relateable feeling at the time. The album inevitably launched Phoebe into stardom, and it’s just such a cool thing to see, as this is an artist I had heard of since college, before her full-length debut. All in all, this album may not be all time favorite number 1 album of a year, but it’s one of the most important number 1 albums on all of the lists I’ve made.\n\nKey Tracks: Kyoto, ICU, Garden Song, Savior Complex"

But the all too real problems surrounding climate change were present particularly in the summer as much of North America was engulfed in smoke. I spent much of my summer at the summit of Whiteface Mountain, collecting cloud water and aerosol data for my eventual dissertation and was truly horrified by how hazy so many of the days were, despite being 100s-1000s of miles away from the actual fires. During the fall, I had the great pleasure of moving to Boulder, Colorado, for a few months, which was a welcome change from being stranded in my apartment.\nThis list really highlights how much women kicked ass in the music industry in 2021, with 9 out of the top 10 albums and 18 of the top 25 albums were from female artists or female led bands. It was also a list that was considerably cheery than its 2020 counterpart which has to be tied to my improved mood throughout 2021. The only critique of this list I probably would have is a general lack of folk/acoustic/singer songwriter type music. Even so, this album was a perfect companion for a year that represented both healing and tragedy."

On “Valentine”, she as a bit older now, which really seems to help developed a more mature and larger sound. The self-titled track is reminiscent of her older work, with a anthemic chorus where she belts “why do you want to erase me”. “Sailing” is probably my favorite vocal performance not only on the record but her entire catelog. It’s hard not to notice how raspy Lindsay’s voice, which add a cool texture throughout the record, but at a cost. Lindsay underwent vocal chord surgery in 2022, which you have to think is from her grueling touring schedule at such a young age. Once Lindsay is ready, she’s got a damn good album to tour on.\n\nKey Tracks: Valentine, Sailing"

The standout track is on “Write A List of Things To Look Forward To”, with yet another catchy riff, and some of Courtney’s best lyrical work in my opinion like “Sit Beside me, watch the world burn.

Bo Burnham already had a great history of comedy songwriting, but he’s just on another level here. The opening track “Content” is just a perfect way to start the special, with simple drum kit and great little synth lines. The special starts off reasonably bright, with razor sharp commentary, but devolved pretty quickly as Bo’s mental health clearly deteriorates right before your eyes. Frankly, there are times that this special is pretty hard to watch (the scene where he’s trying to film a scene and keeps messing the lines up and freaking out makes my stomach turn every time). “That Funny Feeling” is truly a masterpiece that contains raw emotion that artists not trying to be funny could only dream of. But my favorite is the perhaps the silliest, “Bezos I”, which contains a synth part that has absolutely no right to go as hard as it does. Bo Burnham has become not only a great comedian, but a truly amazing songwriter.\n\nKey Tracks: Bezos I, That Funny Feeling"

This album shows so much growth from her and her brother. This duo just approaches music with a subtlety I wish more artists possessed. The real standout on the record however, is Billie’s just truly remarkable vocal performances. Billie has never really been an artist to belt. But on this album, there is just so much confidence and poise that she approaches on every track, like funky “Lost Cause” where she almost whispers at times. “Billie Boss Nova” contains some really great production and rhythm guitar that give the song a lot of personality. Despite all my love for her subtle approach to this record, she gives the album a perfect emotional climax with the iconic title track. I also really enjoyed how Billie spoke back towards the criticisms she was facing throughout the media for things like the double standard of wearing baggy clothes making her not a woman, but losing the layers making her a slut. This is such an exciting follow up from her debut and I await eagerly for what comes next.\n\nKey Tracks: Lost Cause, Billie Bossa Nova"

I have loved Anderson Paak for quite some time now and always had a admiration for Bruno Mar’s talent, and together they don’t disappoint. The opening track “Leave the Door Open” suit Bruno perfectly, akin to love ballads of his early career like “Just the Way You Are” (which is a banger and you’re wrong if you disagree”). There is just so much fun disco and soul throughout the record, where Anderson and Bruno just play off each other so well. The in studio chemistry is just so clearly obvious. “Smoking Out The Window” is song that gets stuck in my head all the time. I just can’t help but sing along to the harmonies on the line “and I was wronnnggg, and she wass gonnnne”. Just a really cool music moment. The album also doesn’t overstay its welcome, only running at about 36 minutes, as this project could have easily become overbloated. “Blast Off” is great way to close the album, feeling like a great summary for the project as a whole. Oh and how can I forget the Thundercat cameos throughout the record that are just so damn funny. I guess I shouldn’t be surprised that two hit machines were able to make an album full of hits.

I was pretty happy with how my first list came out (1s of people thought it was pretty cool), so I spent more time looking for more new music. This was also the year that I got my first record player and my first 4 vinyls which included:\nA pretty great collection if you ask me. I also was off a great senior year of soccer, going undefeated in our league leading to a trip to nationals (where I would score two goals!). In general, my life was going pretty good. For this list, I was still trying to stick to 10 albums, which inevitably made led me to leave some albums I really enjoyed off. To remedy this, I included 4 honorable mentions. I also made my first top 100 songs playlist as well, and frankly, I think its pretty damn good, especially the number 1 pick “Sugar For the Pill” which remains one of my very songs from the 2010s. This ended being a pretty great soundtrack for my final year at ESF."

    "text": "Honorable Mention. Sylvan Esso: What Now\nFew bands make me smile as much as Sylvan Esso. I was also super disappointed to leave this album off the top 10 list, and was the major reason why I included some honorable mentions. This is the followup to their amazing self-titled album, a clever indie-electronica album that sets the apart from other electronic artists. “What Now” is poppier and than its predecessor, perfectly epitomized by the brightly colored track “The Glow”. “Die Young” is a certified banger, detailing the annoyance having to hold off dying young because they found love. “Signal” is great pop anthem that’s worth blasting in your car with the windows rolled down. At it’s core, Sylvan Esso made an album chock full of great songs that ends up with the whole being greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nKey Tracks: The Glow, Die Young, Signal"

    "text": "3. Bon Iver: 22, A Million\nOn this list, albums 2 and 3 are essentially tied, which made picking their spots all the more difficult. We first start off with Bon Iver’s “22, A Million”, after 5 years since the breathtakingly beautiful self title record from 2011. That previous record in addition to the EP “Blood Bank” hinted at the experimentation Justin Vernon would eventually lean into. “22, A Million” is nearly unidentifiable from the debut “For Emma, Forever Ago”, drenched in reverb, autotune and dissonance. And yet, despite all these tricks, the album somehow remains authentic and organic, particularly on the rare occasions when just Justin’s unulterd voice appears. It’s a bit difficult to point out individual tracks as this album really doesn’t contain very many fully developed songs. Instead, tracks largely bleed into each other, sometimes making it difficult to tell if there was song changed. Really, this album is truly best enjoyed all in one sitting. A major standout for me is “715 - CRΣΣKS” (man these are a pain to type out) showcasing just the autotuned harmonies of Justin, that use the spaciousness of the song to its advantage. “8 (circle)” is almost sounds like a something high schoolers would slow dance to in 80s and contains this amazing horn section at minute 3 that I adore. The album ends with “00000 Million”, grounding us as it strips back most of the crazy production leaving behind just choir of vocals and a standup piano, and I just find incredibly comforting. Perhaps the greatest strength of this record is Bon Iver finding ways to push the limits of his sound without losing what makes his music great.\n\nKey Tracks: 715 - CRΣΣKS, 8 (circle), 00000 Million"

Courtney and Kurt’s musical styles compliment each other very well with their casual vocal performances and guitar driven songwriting. There aren’t too many original songs on the record but the ones that are there a truly fantastic. “Over Everything” is a perfect jam that fits perfectly to a soundtrack for the summer. “Continental Breakfast” is a cute song discussing the continental friendship that Courtney and Kurt have made, and just makes me plain happy every time I hear it. They also cover each other’s songs with Kurt covering the classic “Out of the Woodwork”, while Courtney covers “Peepin Tom” (a version that I prefer, despite loving the original). Ifound myself playing this album a lot, especially when I was in a good mood. These two set out to make a fun and pleasant record and they succeeded. Sometimes, that’s all an album needs to be.\n\nKey Tracks: Continental Breakfast, Over Everything, Peepin’ Tom"

    "text": "Honorable Mention. Father John Misty: Pure Comedy\nThis album frustrates me to no end and was a fairly polarizing release for Father John Misty fans. There is so much great songwriting and vocals performances on this record that I’m always happy to talk about, such as the breadth of topics on the title track including human brains being to big to birthed at full size, ending on the great line “I hate to say it, but each other is all we got”. Or the beautiful country-esque ballad on “Smoochie”, describing someone comforting John (or Father John?). And yet, John gets in his own way with these endless self-indulgent tracks like “Leaving LA” or “So I’m Growing Old on Magic Mountain”. These problems really prevent an good album from becoming a great album despite the numerous great songs. Still, I enjoy much of this project, which was enough to warrant an honorable mention, evening if I grumble about it.\n\nKey Tracks: Pure Comedy, Smoochie, Ballad of a Dying Man"

    "text": "5. Peter Silberman: Impermanence\nAn aspect of music that I really enjoy when it’s done well is the use of spaciousness, particularly when it emphasizes something within the music like a melody or to highlight a lyric. “Impermanence” takes this to another level. Peter Silberman (famously of the Antlers and creator of one of the most tragic records ever made “Hospice”) recorded this album after recovering from hearing loss in one ear. This hearing loss inspired him to take a minimalistic approach with just faint touches of guitar, syntths, and his angelic voice. “Karuna” is my favorite, as it opens with just the occasional strum of the guitar and Peter’s powerful vocals before building ever so slightly to include more involved guitar work and just a bit of drums. “New York” explores Peter’s noticing and being overwhelmed by noises in New York City that he once took for granted. The album closes as it should, with simple ambient track on “Impermanence”. This is a such unique project that tries to explore the loneliness of deafness with sound (or the lack there of). It may be a bit difficult for some people to get into it due to its spareness, but incredibly rewarding if you spend time with it.\n\nKey Tracks: Karuna, New York, Ahimsa"
