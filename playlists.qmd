Each year, in addition to my top albums, I make a top songs playlist as well (just in case people don't want to listen to \~25 albums....). These playlists allow me to share songs that I love that aren't necessarily in any of the top albums or only are released as singles.

Typically the playlists consist of 100 songs, ranked from 1-100. In 2018, because I chose 40 albums rather than 10 or 25, I decided against a making top songs playlist. Additionally, for 2016, I did not make a top songs playlist as it was my first ever list. However, for both 2016 and 2018, I made 25 song playlist to showcase some of my favorite songs from those years. Lastly, I also made a playlist for my favorite song of the 2010s.
