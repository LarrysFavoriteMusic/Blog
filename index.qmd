Hello! Welcome to my website/blog. This website is a collection of all of my top album and songs lists that make around December of each year. I may also create some sort of blog if I find the time....

On this website you'll find:

-   My top albums of each year, dating back to 2016.

-   A collection of playlists of my top songs from each year dating back to 2017

-   A collection of websites/podcasts/blogs/etc that I use for music discovery

-   More information on why I make these lists and some thoughts on how approach each year

I put this website together mostly to collect my thoughts on music into one place. However, if you somehow stumbled onto this website, I hope you discover some cool music you may not have heard of before. Thanks for reading!.

If you have suggestions for things for me to listen to, suggestions for the website, or find any bugs (in the website or I guess in real life), email me at [larrysfavoritemusic\@gmail.com](mailto:larrysfavoritemusic@gmail.com)
