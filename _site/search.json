A new president was elected, vaccines for COVID-19 were distributed, the world began opening up again and during the fall, I moved to Boulder Colorado from September to December. This list was probably one of my less experimental years of music, with a fantastic year for women in music (9 out 10 artists in the top 10 and 18 of the top 25 albums were female artists or bands led by women)."

    "text": "This was a very significant year of change for me. I graduated from SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry in May 2018, and started my Ph.D in atmospheric sciences at the University of Albany a couple of weeks later. It seems fitting this was the year I decided switch up the format for the album of the list. If there was one year I could pick redo a list for, it’s probably this one. I decided on choosing 40 albums rather than 10 as there was just a ton of albums I really liked that year that I wanted to represent in some way. Looking at the records chose when writing this, I was right. There just a ton of albums that I enjoy that year. However, 40 was probably too large of a number as their is a pretty noticeable drop off in quality towards the end of the list. The Top 10 would probably be reshuffled pretty significantly as well. Albums like Low’s hauntingly beautiful and experimental “Double Negative” or Beach House’s “7” (and amazing followup to 2 very solid releases in 2015) probably deserve to be higher up on this list, while albums like Lucy Dacus’s “Historian” or the fun hot mess that is Anderson.Paak’s “Oxnard” probably should be lower on the list. Still, this list contains just tons of great music and really highlights just how much there was to enjoy."

This trio includes Amelia Meath of Slyvan Esso, Molly Sarlé, and Alexandra Sauser-Monnig of Daughter of the Swords, all who attended Bennington College together. Together, they produce a master class in minimalistic traditional and indie folk, opting for nothing more than simple acoustic guitar parts and their amazing vocal harmonies. Tracks like “Whale Song” and “Bright Morning Stars” use space perfectly to really necessitate their siren like vocal harmonies. The incredibly cozy and comforting, “Slow Wake Up Sunday Morning” is true highlight from this record, that is only made better in the context of the full album."

I found “Pure Comedy” to be a very frustrating album, containing some of FJM’s very best song writing, but often overshadowed by preachy and pretentious tracks (Leaving La being 11 minutes of just acoustic guitar…). “God’s Favorite Customer” was a pleasant surprise for me, with FJM returning to the vulnerability and lush instrumentation that made 2015’s “I Love You, Honeybear” so fantastic."

A new president was elected, vaccines for COVID-19 were distributed, the world began opening up again and during the fall, I moved to Boulder Colorado from September to December. This list was probably one of my less experimental years of music, with a fantastic year for women in music (9 out 10 artists in the top 10 and 18 of the top 25 albums were female artists or bands led by women)."
