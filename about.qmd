Hello! Thanks for visiting Larry Loves Music (name is pending). For a long time, I've been pretty obsessed with music. In highschool I had the opportunity to do a research project of my choosing. As someone done a lot of science projects (and currently do so for living), I wanted to try something else. I wrote

3.  Make it easier to share my favorite music with a potentially larger audience
